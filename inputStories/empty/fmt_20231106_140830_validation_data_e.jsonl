{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " there was something wrong with elrhain and agwyn both physiologically and emotionally.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " a curse that no other child suffered from.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " it was the disease of knowing that a better life existed far beyond their current reach.\n"}

{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " beggars couldnt be choosers.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " elrhain then wondered if this elven length of time the dhionne lived made most literary things in their culture prodigiously complex.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the uorian language had hundreds of thousands if not millions of characters.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " it had a unique symbol for every little thing in existence like the ancient egyptian or chinese scripts but with more time to ferment.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the mundane version of the language was written as both an alphabet and a syllabary while also showing signs of an abugida.\n"}

{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " in contrast each word was also unique in its own way.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " also dhionne had more vocal organs inside their mouth and throat than humans.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " so their phonetic range out-numbered the human equivalent by orders of magnitudes.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the language was sing-songy.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the grammatical rules were foreign and convoluted stringing words together to make sentences by both rhythm and underlying syntactical guidelines.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " there was no romaji or pinyin but there were combinations of symbols and syllabics that described each phonetic unit.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " each combination was far more complex to write than a regular character of the uorian alphabet slash syllabary slash abugida.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " it took two to three hundred earth years for the average privileged dhionne on earthloch to master it.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " elrhain and agwyn did it in one-tenth the time.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " it was a nightmare but having thirty earth years with nothing else to do did the trick.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " they were already tired of languages yet they had to learn more to do magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " but the language of magic was different from the mundane one.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the runic script consisted of complicated glyphs and simpler runes.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " each glyph was a unique symbol that could be broken down into compound complex and simple units like lego blocks.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " like the mandelbrot set where one could zoom indefinitely.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " but in the case of a single glyph the fractals were finite with each simplest rune being the basic building block.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " nevertheless the fiasco was degrees more intricate than the mundane written script.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " there were an infinite number of these magical runic glyphs for the many fields of magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " such as alchemy rune-writing spirit-telling cultivation arts shamanic rituals and so on so forth.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " there were systematic ways of learning them.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " but at a glance the systems of each field were mutually exclusive unlike earth where chemistry physics biology mathematics and all other sciences were irrevocably interconnected.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the connection here was infinitesimal as far as the practitioners of uorys diosca were concerned.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " elrhain knew that wasnt actually the case.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " still the rulers of this world deemed any exploration of such a subject unnecessary.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " long story short magic was freaking dumb.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " and hard.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " and painful.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " the shamans and mages of the old didnt bother to simplify any of the concepts to make the entry bar lower.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " no mathematics for today booklets for kindergarteners.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " for the local dhionne it took months of contemplation and meditation to comprehend the meaning of the complex glyphs written in their cultivation scriptures.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " it depended on weird things such as sudden inspirations or epiphanies.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " after that they would cultivate non-stop sitting there doing nothing even if their annoyed spouses poked them with sticks.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " so whether it was cultivation and magic or exploring the laws behind them they were daunting tasks that would take hundreds of earth years of continuous effort.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " with no entertainment acting as buffers no breaks that actually counted?\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " it was droll.\n"}

{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " maybe if cultivation was as addictive as binge-watching romantic soap operas.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " maybe if elrhain were a mad scientist and not a boring everyday one he could grit his teeth and endeavour to become an oceanic or sky realmer as fast as possible.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " all the while unearthing one secret of manna after another.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " but he wasnt.\n"}

{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " he ran away more than he charged ahead.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " and he could say that agwyn and ninety percent of earthlings living in big cities of the thirty-first century were the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " they followed the easy proven way.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " they were both curious beings like everyone else.\n"}

{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " they both wanted to make the world a better place in their own image again like everyone else.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " but they werent the type to risk their lives intentionally.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " nor were they the type to sit on a magical glowing rock meditating two-thirds of their time awake.\n"}

{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " they didnt want boring.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " it was much easier to adapt earth technology here.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " he didnt need to do the magic himself.\n"}
{"prompt": "\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " he could show a direction and teach the theory.\n"}
