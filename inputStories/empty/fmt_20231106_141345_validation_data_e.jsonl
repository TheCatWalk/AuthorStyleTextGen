{"prompt": "", "completion": " there are new servants?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " no i am serious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who is that new guy behind servant korna?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the servant in question stopped the moment he noticed the prince looking at him.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " what servant?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " korna is the last one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one two.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " b-but?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain gasped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a strange pressure was squeezing down his chest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the air was heavy like breathing mercury.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ellie?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn tapped his face but his vision blurred like a mirage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one world overlapped with another in a psychedelic mix of faces.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " seven.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " seven.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rhain?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra grazed his face with a concerned expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she then turned towards the line of servants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the vine-bearded man in question stopped while the six others continued to climb.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his frightened eyes crossed elrhains and the man took a slow step backwards.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " green manna gathered at his bark-skinned feet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " intruder!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if at last seeing the anomaly cyra screamed at the top of her lungs and encompassed the entire area with a rampaging torrent of vaporous manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and as the screen of blue from cyras magic shielded elrhains vision the suffocating feeling vanished.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain lost his balance but agwyn supported him from behind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hes escaping!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain cried.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by then the vine-bearded man had stomped on the ground with green sparks igniting on his legs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the soil under his feet opened up and he dropped down out of their vision.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but cyra was faster.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her domineering magic pierced through an invisible veil shrouding the area no one noticed existed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " instantly the world in front of them shattered like glass.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man reappeared a few meters away from where the hole opened.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a mirage!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he panicked then deflected a water missile with his sword and hurled into the forest foliage head-first.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the sudden turn of events threw the servants and the incoming nobles off their feet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but their training kicked in similar to how the out-tribals reacted to the gheistrum outbreak.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the servants dropped everything in their hands and evacuated the area.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at the same time the nobles raised their manna spreading apart to encircle the vine-bearded man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " careful he is a soul mage!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mid oceanic!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra warned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain noticed more surges of manna descending from the summit of the mountain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra squatted down to their eye level.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you are safe my babies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " father thundham will keep his sight on you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyras eyes were enflamed red in wrath.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain had never seen the women so angry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she left with a gust of wind in pursuit but her protective barrier remained.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few seconds later thundham appeared beside them like a flickering image.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he picked elrhain and agwyn up with a sombre face and flew towards the top of the mountain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked over the old mans shoulder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he saw a dragon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 70 - sparks\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dragon roared the air around her trembling in force and fear.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cerulean water and violet mist rose around her massive form as she flew out of the mountainside chasing after the interloper.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her wyvern head adorned a crown of amethyst and sapphires.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her wings glowed like shattered mirrors and her body flooded the sky in a serpentine shadow.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the vine-bearded man now sitting on the back of a black-winged lion threw out one magic spell after another to no avail.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the tiny fireballs and miasma-spheres plopped like balloons when they made contact with the dragons plated scales.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dragon roared again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could see the fury in her eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " manna gathered in waves around the skyspace.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dragon and the lion competed for supremacy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but in less than ten heartbeats the former dominated the latter in sheer magnitude of violence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the manna swooped down in waves as if bowing to the victor as they gave off their neon hues.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the brilliant colours consolidated in spirals and settled into a colossal dome of light covering half the mountain ridge.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain saw a look of panic on the vine-bearded mans face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the intruder and his winged mount crashed into the dome like a meteor manna exploding in all directions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was clear that this charge was their last-ditch effort to escape an enraged mothers wrath.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it was futile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra the faediaga eldress of water ice and plumes whipped her crystalline tail faster than elrhains eyes could follow and plummeted the black-winged lion into the forest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the last thing elrhain saw before thundham flew out of range was the lion exploding in a shower of blood and flesh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " while cyra now back in her dhionne-form lifted the paralyzed and near-death vine-bearded man up by his neck.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " assassins.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain muttered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked out of the window.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the raucous voices of many dhionne invaded their room from outside.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the impromptu meeting thundham had convened raged in full storm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned cradled him and agwyn in the dark of the night.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman was now deeply asleep but her closed eyes showed signs of distress.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " assassins.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn echoed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you were right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " weird.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i wish i wasnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a lot of dhionne died.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you think the gheistrum outbreak was planned too?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my instincts tell me it was.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but how is that possible?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no magic can control a manna-riogh like that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at least according to what we learnt the two fell back into silence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i hate being small.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn spoke again after ten minutes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra was a dragon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe you can turn into one too after cultivating to a higher realm?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how long would that take?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ten cycles?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " twenty?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mommy is over three hundred!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she is older than grandpa!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn rolled over facing elrhain with clear lilac eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the time i am that strong my butt would be sore red from being a punching bag.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its not that bad.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am sure the big guy and uncle morys will toughen the security.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they will make us cultivate non-stop.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by usual standards reaching the sky realm before the age of fifty is already remarkable for a supreme talent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im not one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sorry why are you apologizing?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you already ignited all your nodes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you have to wait longer because of me agwyn scooted closer then pecked him on the lips with a whisper.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dummy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will have to wait until i am ten.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so you better work hard not to waste more time alright?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain bobbed his head and the silence returned but sleep would not come.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the princeling tried counting to a hundred backwards.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he meditated controlled his breath four in seven out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but his minds pesky wandering became unbearable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we will still lose.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to those people.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont know who they are but would it make a difference even if i cultivate all the time?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " can we stop them from hurting us harming our subjects?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it takes an unreasonable amount of time for me to light one node.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its not like i dont try.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but manna hates me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will protect us.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i want to protect you too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i cant cultivate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that isnt my path.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what are you thinking?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain closed his eyes then shook his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he lay there in stifling quietness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the moonlight outside flowed in like milky manna kissing his distraught face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or maybe it was agwyn again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " comprehensive strength.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn squeaked in confusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is what the fishing pole increased.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these assassins why did they attack now?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " today and not wait for a sure-hit moment?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn thought for a while before making a conclusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone thinks we are like little sages.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so the enemy wants to snuff out our talents.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they investigated our routine and planned an attack.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but if so .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its too sloppy!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont know about the vine-bearded man the slug woman took down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe he was sneaking in early to set traps.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his soul magic was potent enough to even fool cyra.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we are lucky that our souls are fucked up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " otherwise i doubt i could have detected him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hey!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that woman in white.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her ambush was hasty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if she capitalized on a sudden chance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we only had alleigh and captain anouk with us today sure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we also went rather far from our regular routes visiting the out-tribals.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but we are the clan successors.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one oceanic realmer is not enough to guarantee success.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that woman could have acted alone.agwyn said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and not under the command of a team.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so this was a one in a million golden opportunity for her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the vine-bearded man could be from another faction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but in that case the question is how she could predict when the gheistrum outbreak would occur.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shamans are always on the lookout for these things.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how could the out-tribals not notice but the woman in white could?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one possibility is that she was the one who triggered it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn clapped her hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or what if the target of the gheistrum outbreak is not us but someone in the out-tribal settlement?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " another force triggered the outbreak while the woman in white was tailing us.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she simply took advantage of the mayhem!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhian ruffled his hair in annoyance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that doesnt explain why half the kiklas came for us.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " geez so many possible scenarios.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if there is one hostile force then they dont have that many spies they can use.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if there are multiple they are cooperating but each has different objectives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman in white whoever triggered the outbreak and the vine-bearded man in any case one thing is for sure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one of those objectives is getting rid of us.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman in white acted on it the vine-bearded man messed up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn sulked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she grabbed his head by his cheek and turned it her way.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain blinked smiling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or maybe i am mistaken.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whatever the case i dont want to lose.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie do you want to know why dealing with the food problem is first on my list?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn shook her head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in earthloch whether or not cultivator the dhionne spend the majority of their waking hours either gathering or hunting food like our ancestors of palaeolithic earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only after filling their stomachs will they spend any surplus energy on other things.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like thinking innovating and cultivating.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but nobles aside most of our servants and freemen are uneducated laymen who merely wish to survive not thrive.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if they have a calorie left over they choose to spend that on cultivation thought and innovation be damned!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " heck even the big guy spends most of his time outside putting down gheist hordes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats hunting thats gathering food.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this primitive life binds the chieftain too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain paused to gather his thoughts while agwyn snuggled into a more comfortable position and echoed her affirmations indicating she understood.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ninety percent of cultivators are brutish warriors.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ninety percent of cultivators mindlessly follow scriptures without further thoughts as to why or how.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after thousands of cycles of cumulative study and truth-seeking their progress is a pitiful special technique that is more destructive.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what a waste of time!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what better is that than apes figuring out how to poke beehives with longer sticks?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you know earthloch has three hundred thousand cycles of history?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is three million earth years!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is longer than the entire human races advent starting from when the first human evolved from tree-dwellers to dirt walkers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but look at this these earthlochian dhionne still glorified hunter-gatherers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the only difference is that they stay in one place unlike nomads.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i think thats because of manna-rioghs and other hostile factors.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i also heard the impelakty is far ahead in technology than us whether magic or infrastructure even though they were established about the same time as earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " same for most other high noble clans.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the oumental diuvakty has magic towers that can fly like zeppelins.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the small ruolf eyrshakty in the south can build ships that sail the void.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and earthloch can face them head-on with nothing but brute force.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but in my opinion we still lost.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they lost long ago when the other high noble clans left them behind in authentic magical or scientific progress.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " while we today are content in the resource-rich mountains and lakes of the north.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we dont even have wheels for collectives sake!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " therefore grandpa thundham has been encouraging to train more thinkers in the elders rest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he sees what the future will be if we cant solve these issues from the root our inevitable defeat as more time passes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why could the cold resource-starved europe conquer the world?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because of progress.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " china india africa.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these historically more prosperous kingdoms and empires were toppled over by the unstoppable trend of times that is scientific progress and turned into bread-basket colonies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats why no matter what anyone says the collapse is a bona fide blessing for earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it will give the dhionne here not only a chance to progress in personal strength but societal too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it gives us time.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was no longer a given that servants starve and die for their masters.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn chirped then yawned while rubbing her eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she continued people will only listen to us because of our status.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the strength of our family ensures that status.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats why reanakt saphur and everyone else asked for permission before using something so simple as a fishing pole.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " distributing that source of that strength and status with impunity is the same as slowly strangling the main house to death.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well i hate to admit it but the only way we can bring the societal change we envision is to become stronger ourselves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn stopped then rubbed elrhains cheeks with hers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont pout and dont apologize.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " being bad at cultivation isnt your fault and we have to wait until we are ten cycles old to break through to the earthen realm either way.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " at the end of the day it all came back to cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a catch-22.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he wanted to change earthloch into a fairer society where the collective strength of the people would overtake the current strength of the few by orders of magnitude.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but to do that he needed to become one of the strongest few himself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the oral rehydration solution and the fishing pole they invented were in fact elrhain testing the waters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though in the first case they really didnt have much choice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how would these easily applicable innovations change earthloch?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how fast would these changes come and how many objections would they face?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the test was a success in a sense.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because they solved pressing issues the clan faced right now there werent any objections to speak of.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could invent simple solutions to simpler problems and distribute them to the people.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wheels cement sharper swords and pointier spears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nobles would distribute them among the servant populace.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but therein lie the problem.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nobles let the servants use such mundane tools with ease of mind while greedily hoarding the better-quality cultivation resources.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " take the fishing pole.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after its usage spread among the mortals like wildfire one unexpected change occurred that elrhain didnt foresee.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the noble families tightened their grasp on earthen and up manna-rich resources even more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since now the servants could catch their own manna poor gheists which were more than enough to fill their bellies and fuel their cultivation they wouldnt need their usual quota of earthen gheist meat anymore no?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats what they thought.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before most of the catch from the hunt and delve teams went to nobles and the dregs went to servants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now all of such catch went to nobles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes mortals could benefit more from the mortal realm catch from the lakes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it stopped starvation and aided their cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " also yes not all nobles were like this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for example the haragols.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet most were.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was a new boon granted by new technology.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why did the mortals have to be deprived of a boon they already enjoyed before?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was as if many nobles consciously or subconsciously realized a threat of the sword of damocles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to mention just as how reanakt saphur had to ask the main house for permission to use the fishing pole the servants had to do the same with their respective master houses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this repressive mentality of the nobles the main house included pissed elrhain off to no end.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn had to soothe him with kisses and hugs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain realized that practical frameworks like the fishing pole would not fundamentally change the power dynamic and common sense of earthlochian society.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " indeed itll make the poor slightly richer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " which was enough so that a fishing pole was a life-saving grace to them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the same thing made nobles exponentially wealthier ironically taking away existing wealth from the poor.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but as for ideological change starting with the free dissemination of knowledge was a different matter altogether.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " let alone freedom of expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a library full of cultivation techniques that any dhionne could access regardless of status a source of manna-rich resources and ichors that were not owned by the noble houses and places of trade and governance not controlled by the current rulers?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well for now all elrhain could do was dream.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you already said slowly steadily we can make it better.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you arent getting cold feet just because the slow and steady is even slower than what you imagined are you?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn giggled at elrhains glare.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this catch-22 wasnt really unsolvable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would just take a ridiculous amount of time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " time they had being born dhionne who lived ten times longer than humans.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " more so because they were cultivators.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the problem wasnt that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was elrhains mental sanity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 72 insanity of time\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i bet that dhionne have anti-insanity modules in their brains.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they can cheerily spend their long-ass lives living the same way every day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain sighed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whatever that brain module was he and agwyn obviously lacked it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each cycle was ten years.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the time elrhain would be a teenager here he would have lived twice as long as he had on earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " which was absolutely crazy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains soul was human.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " human souls werent meant to take that long to be bloody teenagers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the sense of urgency and the level of impatience he and agwyn felt daily despite literally having all the time in the world was not something their family could comprehend.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the mere thought that he had to spend that much time from now on doing nothing but cultivating was enough for him to curl up and cry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " worse yet this was a world without trillions of hours of mindless entertainment they could stream on the internet or enjoy first-hand in the virtual world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no comics games novels movies full dive mmos and book clubs to drink tea with friends.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the withdrawal symptoms were fatal for modern souls and the potent drugs were nowhere in sight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats why he and agwyn had been visiting every settlement they could for the last few months.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " meeting new people reading new scrolls.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " anything to stave off the soul-numbing boredom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but for how long?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had already visited all native earthlochian settlements and the only option left was the out-tribal hamlets.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that went about as well as no one expected.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sure he needed excitement.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he didnt need it so bad as to become traumatized.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he wasnt at the point where hed risk his life for one sniff of white powder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " newer earthlochian settlements were popping up with every group of incoming dhionne but that would also end by the following season.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he didnt want to visit out-tribals anymore either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what were they going to do to pass the time after that?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just read in the archives?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " play the same tag games and have similar conversations with the same people?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain wanted no needed change.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was the same for agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had a list of earth concepts they could rather easily adapt on earthloch lands and a more challenging list of things they couldnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if they got lost in that research they could perhaps spend the next decade in cycles not years with things to actually do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after that what to do was a problem for a future and hopefully better adapted elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet as things stood now after todays assaults there was no way elrhains family would allow them to waste time doing stuff that was not cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was funny in a sense.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the future was both certain and uncertain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uncertain because there were things elrhain and agwyn had decided albeit vaguely to do to pass their mindbogglingly long lifespans that they now couldnt do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " certain because with their current toddler bodies and low not-getting-instakilled abilities the only thing they were allowed to do was cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the last few seasons were exciting.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it felt like years and it had been years in earth terms since they moved to lochuir from their home in the siaglas reanakty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but after these few years things had settled into the routine once again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the advent of newness made three past cycles feel like a far distant mirage to their excitement-starved minds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this happened fast turning their memories into an infinite fugue they neither could hear clearly nor wanted anymore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when they had done nothing but crawl and talk on a crib-like bed with only one window to look outside.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even as they learnt to walk and run they were limited in that one siaglas residence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " seeing the same scenery and feeling the same wind for thirty damn years.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats why when they learnt they would finally leave that well-intentioned prison for something new something not home their emotions had gone haywire.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain doubted if agwyn would have ever confessed her love without that as a catalyst.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but just as rapidly the newness had come it was turning into a routine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they once more faced the problem.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " day by day the excitement fades away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " soon everything would become familiar.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and mundane.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and they could not even leave the siorrakty because of the collapse.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " blessings for the clan it might be but a new prison for the two all the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " actually even doing research for the next decade-cycle wouldnt solve this issue at its core.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was something wrong with elrhain and agwyn both physiologically and emotionally.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a curse that no other child suffered from.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was the disease of knowing that a better life existed far beyond their current reach.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the effort it would take to reach it was daunting.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes they could dive deep into the mysteries of manna to learn and discover things about magic no one else knew.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " every day it would be exciting.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and if it was exciting every day then it really wasnt exciting was it?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but at least there was hope.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however complex and convoluted it was.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " beggars couldnt be choosers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain then wondered if this elven length of time the dhionne lived made most literary things in their culture prodigiously complex.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the uorian language had hundreds of thousands if not millions of characters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it had a unique symbol for every little thing in existence like the ancient egyptian or chinese scripts but with more time to ferment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the mundane version of the language was written as both an alphabet and a syllabary while also showing signs of an abugida.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were simultaneously tens and hundreds of synonyms of a word.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in contrast each word was also unique in its own way.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " also dhionne had more vocal organs inside their mouth and throat than humans.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so their phonetic range out-numbered the human equivalent by orders of magnitudes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the language was sing-songy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the grammatical rules were foreign and convoluted stringing words together to make sentences by both rhythm and underlying syntactical guidelines.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was no romaji or pinyin but there were combinations of symbols and syllabics that described each phonetic unit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each combination was far more complex to write than a regular character of the uorian alphabet slash syllabary slash abugida.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it took two to three hundred earth years for the average privileged dhionne on earthloch to master it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain and agwyn did it in one-tenth the time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a nightmare but having thirty earth years with nothing else to do did the trick.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were already tired of languages yet they had to learn more to do magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the language of magic was different from the mundane one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the runic script consisted of complicated glyphs and simpler runes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each glyph was a unique symbol that could be broken down into compound complex and simple units like lego blocks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like the mandelbrot set where one could zoom indefinitely.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but in the case of a single glyph the fractals were finite with each simplest rune being the basic building block.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nevertheless the fiasco was degrees more intricate than the mundane written script.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were an infinite number of these magical runic glyphs for the many fields of magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " such as alchemy rune-writing spirit-telling cultivation arts shamanic rituals and so on so forth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were systematic ways of learning them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but at a glance the systems of each field were mutually exclusive unlike earth where chemistry physics biology mathematics and all other sciences were irrevocably interconnected.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the connection here was infinitesimal as far as the practitioners of uorys diosca were concerned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain knew that wasnt actually the case.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still the rulers of this world deemed any exploration of such a subject unnecessary.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " long story short magic was freaking dumb.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and hard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and painful.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shamans and mages of the old didnt bother to simplify any of the concepts to make the entry bar lower.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no mathematics for today booklets for kindergarteners.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for the local dhionne it took months of contemplation and meditation to comprehend the meaning of the complex glyphs written in their cultivation scriptures.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it depended on weird things such as sudden inspirations or epiphanies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after that they would cultivate non-stop sitting there doing nothing even if their annoyed spouses poked them with sticks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so whether it was cultivation and magic or exploring the laws behind them they were daunting tasks that would take hundreds of earth years of continuous effort.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with no entertainment acting as buffers no breaks that actually counted?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was droll.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the effort elrhain could give.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but living a perpetual watching the paint dry life?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe if cultivation was as addictive as binge-watching romantic soap operas.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe if elrhain were a mad scientist and not a boring everyday one he could grit his teeth and endeavour to become an oceanic or sky realmer as fast as possible.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all the while unearthing one secret of manna after another.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he wasnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was just elrhain and he was bored out of his mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was a man of science whose life work was an accidental invention.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was an investor and a billionaire who lived life under every mindless luxury possible.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was a good fella according to his girlfriend.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but in her words you aint no idol of perseverance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he ran away more than he charged ahead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and he could say that agwyn and ninety percent of earthlings living in big cities of the thirty-first century were the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they followed the easy proven way.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were both curious beings like everyone else.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one hoping for adventure another hoping to seek the unknown.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they both wanted to make the world a better place in their own image again like everyone else.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but they werent the type to risk their lives intentionally.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nor were they the type to sit on a magical glowing rock meditating two-thirds of their time awake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nor did they want to sit on a chair for the same amount of time watching one magic tree sap react with another magic fishbone amidst hundreds of thousands of science failures.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all of that was boring.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they didnt want boring.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was much easier to adapt earth technology here.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he didnt need to do the magic himself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could show a direction and teach the theory.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the mages and shamans could write up the glyphs arrays and rituals to make blast furnaces and steam turbines.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who knows?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he might awaken to the joys of teaching.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " another avenue to explore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain had no concrete plans for the future.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only vague visions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he wanted to grow up as fast as possible but time wouldnt let him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he wanted to create a society where every dhionne could be if not satisfied then at least contented.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " time wouldnt let him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if elrhain was even ten cycles older with an earthen cultivation base none of this wouldve mattered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a mature body could do things to pass time that an underdeveloped toddler couldnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he wasnt an adult not even a tween.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was weak and twiddly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and assassins after his life didnt help ease any of that stress.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the more you think about it the more you will feel depressed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn snuggled up to him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was the only person in the world who understood his dilemma of having both too much and too little time.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " but she too didnt want to spend the next ten or twenty cycles of her life cultivating.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the girl would literally implode because of inertia.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boys brain hanged.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " for safety and your hair!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn turned her tearful eyes towards cyra.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " h-hey dhionne rituals arent that bad.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the grand shamanka said we could also use nails and blood!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra hastily defended dhionne magic but the twitch in her words made her a horrible lawyer.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the naeman witch speaks the truth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their kind is far more proficient in these sorts of rituals than our shamans.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " id say the trinket is worth it.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " y-yes!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie will be super grumpy without hair!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn tugged on her mothers robe and started wailing again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay i get it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont cry gwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra sighed then nodded at alorakana.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain swore he could see a triumphant twinkle in the witchs eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn excitedly ran to her and snatched the death teller from her long-nailed hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so how does the trinket work?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tudor asked with interest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eudav and arfons ears also perked up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alorakana tilted her head with squinting eyes then smiled like a cat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she went into a cryptic theory of manna aspects and glyphs while taking every chance to mention other of her cryptic ware.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain had no interest in any of that for now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he turned his gaze towards agwyns open palms where the death teller lay.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other cousins surrounded the two and looked at the icy necklace with keen eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it changed hands one by one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn winced when cadough gave it a lick.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra was the last one to observe the necklace.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her eyes glowed a neon blue as she held it up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for some reason she nodded in satisfaction and then returned the trinket which was actually a high-level talisman back to agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the naeman witchs prideful boasts came from behind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after cyra judged that today they need not perform any tingly hair-ruining ritual with the death teller on hand the group had turned around.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some noisy minutes passed and they were once more near the exit of the mural inscribed passageway from where they had entered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little princess wore the death teller and tucked it under her collar.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " clicking her tongue she changed her mind and untucked the necklace again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the whole point would be futile if this death teller was hidden behind clothes when it well told of death.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not that they knew how it did so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain made a mental note to ask the witch after her boasting ended.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " huh somethings weird.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy suddenly said through their link his eyes catching an anomaly in the transparent shard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whys there a crack in the middle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt like this a moment ago and its growing bigger.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " did she give you a broken product?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uhh really?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded in response as they stepped out of the passageway into the previous cavern.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn held the necklace up in front of her eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the bioluminescence illuminated their faces.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it flicked off elrhains eyes as they followed as the crack fissuring larger almost bisecting it in two vertical halves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alorakanas voice reached his ears with the underground wind as the colour in agwyns face faded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the moment this fate aspected glyph picks up on the death of the wearers soul the lamionite fatestone on the death teller necklace will crack.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " within breaths it will split in two.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the count has already begun by now as has the future changed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the wearer knows of the danger and will inevitably struggle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her effort might save her life or extend the time of deaths arrival.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it may even hasten it if she were particularly unlucky that day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hmm whats wrong little princess?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why are you holding up the death teller by the voids!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn now visibly panicking like she had lost a duckling in a desert raised the two halves of the necklace towards the three adults in their group with trembling hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she gulped and with much difficulty managed to squeak m-mommy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 74 - third beat underground\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra responded in a blink.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain saw a burst of water and the faediaga eldress was standing in front of the group with wary eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " glistening blue manna from her body permeated throughout the cavern.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " part of it turned into tendrils that crisscrossed in open space.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it filled the whole cavern like molecular threads ready to ensnare and dismember any foe that appeared.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the rest gathered around the children in a half-spherical barrier that rotated gently.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyras eyes didnt move from the clearing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she took out a sapphire medallion and shattered it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a bird of blue light like the one agwyn summoned from her talisman near the seven pearl lakes flew out from the cracks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it released a shallow cry then split into five each travelling down one pathway leading away from the cavern.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " including the one from which they had just exited.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tudor hoisted a gnarly staff.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he ruffled his beard while showing agwyn a reassuring smile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the staff bottom tapped the cavern floor with each of his steps.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " pulses of blue manna spread out in circular waves where the staff tapped the mossy stone then encompassed the barrier as a second line of defence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alorakana fidgeted nervously to the side as she bit her lips mumbling by the voids.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " t-this is not what we agreed on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain gave her a stinky glance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the witch genuinely looked terrified.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he patted her legs saying i bet you have a bunch of talismans lying around.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i think this is the time to use them- two changes happened simultaneously interrupting his well-intentioned advice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a roar echoed from many of the passageways honeycombed into the cavern.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it came from below?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " followed by a low rumbling of the earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " another roar followed then another.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " soon it was like the cacophony of earthlochs primordial forest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the cries of beasts the flutter of wings and the distinct sound of chitinous appendage on stone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the first roar was distinctly different from the others.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it had intent?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked at his feet and saw the specks of gravel vibrate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked up at cyra.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her face tensed but for a split second it looked relieved before morphing into worry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thinking about it the first roar resembled cyra when she was in her draconic form.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " reinforcements.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or theres a battle breaking out elsewhere.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she scuttled up beside him and pointed her finger towards a lone ruined pillar.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i hope they get here soon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the last roars sounded like gheistrums.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " more frenzied.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the second change the pillar with murals of lost ages carved upon its body wobbled as if it was a reflection on troubled water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tiny blue crystals jutted out from the cracks on the pillar simmering the anomaly in dim cyan light.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a horizontal line cut through the pillars vertical axis and split open like a beast opening its mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the pillar didnt break.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the space around the cut pushed apart like a rubber sheet the murals on both sides of the pillar stretched like drawings on an inflating balloon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the cut soon turned into a full circle behind which lay a gaping white void.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a noise broke like a thousand critters and skitters of teeth upon teeth and claws upon glass.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains ears rang but the sheer force of cyras manna soon overwhelmed the sound.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the faediaga eldress didnt give whatever was on the other side a chance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " boom!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain only saw her raising a hand and the mural along with the gap in space exploded as though a hundred-ton truck full of water had crashed into it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vapour rose and the dusty mist spread but cyra didnt stop.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she cast spell after spell while tudor readied his own offence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alorakana darted back taking out a parchment scroll from her cleavage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra scrunched her brows her slug-like lower body tensed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the faediaga eldress halted her spell casting with an annoyed click of her tongue.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that cant be good.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the water-webbed skirt around cyras slug tail drew back on the floor before she vaulted out like a catapult.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " manna gathered upon her open palms forming spell matrices.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she pulled her hands back and formed fists to punch out but a shadow shaped like a spear forced her to hastily block in front.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman in white!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn shouted pointing towards the familiar assassin with more rage than her mother.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was the culprit who messed up her dear alleigh and captain anouk.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra knocked aside the spear and went straight for the interloper but from behind the woman in white came seven more spears stopping her in her charge again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the impact blew away the screen of mist and dust so now everyone had a clear view of their enemies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she stood there no sign of the injuries she had sustained not even a day prior.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a dozen more white spears inlaid with complex engravings and glimmering gheist cores hung on her back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was covered in full body armour.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was clear she did not come here for a chat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain gulped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman in white wasnt alone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " behind her seven more dhionne stepped out from the gap.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no portal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each cladded white armour decked with an arsenal of manna enchanted equipment with spears aplenty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but they werent what spooked elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thousands upon thousands of black rats with humongous ears and bulbous eyes poured out from the portal like a waterfall bringing along a foul smell and purple smog.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they only parted when they met the assassins like the wave upon rocks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the rats scampered and cried in a tsunami of ear-splitting screeches then crashed onto cyra and the barrier protecting the children with blood lighted eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ten hours ago in a grotto in a mountain a few kilometres away from the seven pearl lakes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman in white stood before a pool of sparkling water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " beside her a similarly draped girl healed her with the best recovery magic from the impelakty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " two giant men stood a step behind their eyes fixed upon the pool.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after a few quick minutes of wait the water in the pool swirled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " specks of manna flowed up and formed a humanoid shadow.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dhionne kneeled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we greet the impelakt the holy light upon the exalted disc.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a voice sounding like the echo of a hundred bells spoke.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " speak.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " did you confirm the tether reconer galina?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman in white reconer galina spoke after showing the impelakt rite for deference.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " there is an unbreakable tether connecting the earthloch princess and her betrothed boy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " similar to the records detailing the founders.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i could only see it after casting a sky ranked astral sight spell with the help of a talisman.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few silent minutes passed then a tired sigh escaped from the humanoid shadow.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other reconers were all kneeling so their faces were unseen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but many among them had shocked expressions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not at the prospect of their target being like their founders but at the impelakts show of even if subtle weakness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the impelakt cared not for their musings knowing he would see none of these reconers again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the ending task he would order had little chance of them returning alive.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " they will join you within the hour.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " would it not be optimal to recover the two tethered children?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i do not mean to undermine the lights decree.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still they might be the founder and his impelaktess reincarnated if the records of the imperial archives are true.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was the collapse as well.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the first impelaktess she was the blood elder sister of earthlochs founder.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was speechless listening to a bona fide witch complain about sorcery.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but her worries were not unfounded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im guessing its a temporary boost.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whatever the attackers ate looked similar to the thing in the woman in whites hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but why is the leader taking so long to do the same thing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he mused aloud.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unless she isnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a relief when shaman maeog along with a few more faces he didnt recognise jumped into the fray.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " maeog swung around his hammer-like staff and bashed one attacker away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the attackers chest caved in and he coughed out blood and pus.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but his wounds healed in the blink of an eye and before maeog could jump back the attacker grabbed his sword and threw the old man like a sling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he crashed onto a half smashed boulder smashing it completely this time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dust rose like a smokescreen and from inside a truck-sized ball of ice flew out hitting the attacker square in the face.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " not only do you go after my daughter but my flock too?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her manna rose higher and the cavern quacked coarser.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if to match her rage the five fake sky realmers also rushed in with wanton ferocity as if physical wounds were a disposable resource.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wheres the woman in white?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain flailed his chubby arms up and down while agwyn nodded along hugging him tightly.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " his voice had not left his mouth when the remaining five attackers screamed with a beastly sonic boom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they forwent all defences not caring for the claws and fangs tearing apart their flesh.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " stay back!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra enveloped the children with her serpentine body squeezing inside the barrier.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then she along with maeog tudor the old shamaness and even alorakana frantically fed all their remaining manna into it.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " something deep inside him snapped and agony a million times worse than the pain from the blast overwhelmed his soul.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the impelakt had foreseen that pure destructive power even at the sky realmer level could not break through the earthloch defences.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he had granted her this spell that morphed her body into an astral form that no one could touch or harm along with a plan to eliminate the targets without fail.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " galina carried it out spectacularly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it took an ancillary riogh hearts worth of 'time' 'soul' and 'space' aspected manna embedded in the device and the gateway behind her to cast the spell.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still all was worth it for the impelakt's will.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since the life of eight competent reconers was this mission's actual price.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " astral beings lived on manna to exist in the material world.\n"}
