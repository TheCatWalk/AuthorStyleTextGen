{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadwell had of course noticed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had been sworn brothers for too long while by blood they were cousins.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the winged man tactfully ignored bromwyn's inner turmoil before leaving for his task.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn wasn't sure about the rest of his men but he prayed that they hadn't gleaned of his weakness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " every cycle these people lost those dear to them to one fateless cause or another.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had been the lucky one all his life pardoned from losing anyone of significance in an untimely manner.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he took a deeper breath his chest rising and falling with the mantra in his heart.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whatever may happen will.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he no they had tried their best in the short window of time they had.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the uncertainty of the situation didn't lessen the pain and worry of course haunting him of visions if the worst comes to pass.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to mention his wife who was already weak from a past injury and went through a difficult childbirth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was a faediaga.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the heavens did not like her bearing the child of a dhionne.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " collecting his thoughts through the short respite bromwyn looked up at the dark skies covering the disc as if to search for answers to his plight among the stars.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was then that runner iau sprinted into the temporary camp with all the huffing and puffing of a farm beast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy was as short as his father but a secret art of the earthloch main house gifted him with the speed of the autumn wind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chieftain!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he shouted gasping for breath almost falling over g-good news!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn held the young boy up by his arms steady lad.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then ordered one of the hunters to get the runner a skin of manna infused freshwater.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " drink and calm yourself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whatever news you have it won't do us any good if you faint before you can tell us.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the chieftain asked with a little bit of hope and unease whatever made you run back seventeen miles in less than a quarter-hour should be significant enough that you are steady when you speak it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the lad thanked the chieftain slowly gulping down the offered water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few breaths later he spoke the grand elder is waiting for you at the watches your grace.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn shouted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his father was just as worried about the newborn as he was if not more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so why was he a hundred miles away from the clan township at such a time?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there is more iau exclaimed this time a well-intentioned grin forming on his face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uncle elder croneira is with him too!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they say the princess is well!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn waited no more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the words had barely left iau tudur earthloch's lips when the other man practically bolted off the disc towards the nearby watchtower with the speed of the north wind leaving a bewildered trail of hunters and a tornado of grass and leaves in his wake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " father!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn shouted as he slammed open the door to the sentry house the whole tower below seemed to rock at the force.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course that was just an illusion playing tricks on his unsettled mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the towers were built too sturdy to be rocked by the feelings of a distressed father.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were four people in the room.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " an old man was looking out of the northern window towards a vast lake beyond the lake itself could only partially be seen with its more significant part hidden behind the lush mountains.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was his father the grand elder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had grizzled white hair and a short yet flowy beard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the reed hat on his head gave off a rustic scent giving other's the impression he was but a fisher or farmhand servant.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the sharp glint in his aged lilac eyes told a different story.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder croneira was seated by the table drinking aged fruit pulp out of a shell cup.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she looked worse for wear with fatigue visible on her already decrepit face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the signs of worry were long gone bromwyn noticed replaced by something else.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the last two were servants with one being feylis whom he recognized as one of the maids tending to his wife during the labour.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was standing to the side with a dazzling younger man wearing a hunter's garb the servants' sigil visible on his exposed arms with a bone blade hung to his back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his posture was steady yet the clenching fists did nothing to hide the young man's inner turmoil.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " feylis was alternating her gaze between these three people until bromwyn's loud boom jolted her straight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn you've come.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old man spoke but his gaze was not removed from the glistening lake water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " father i've heard the news from iau.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is it true?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn impatiently asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are my daughter's ailments really cured?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the grand elder didn't respond the old man simply stroked his silky beard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was elder croneira who spoke up chieftain if i may interject.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasn't an ailment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was nothing to cure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then what was it that almost took her life?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn was taken aback.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he wondered if they had made a big fuss for nothing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that would indeed be embarrassing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it was better than his daughter catching an untreatable fatal curse worse yet than her inner core born cracked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is hard to explain my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to put it bluntly it was our lack of immediate judgement that- are you telling me you almost messed up the childbirth!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn uncharacteristically raged slamming the table with his giant palms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " silence!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his father yelled warning the burly chieftain sternly with a raspy voice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the elder has explained to me the details.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no one should be held responsible for what was but fate's fickle design.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn calmed pulling himself apart from the darker thoughts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he immediately apologized to elder croneira for his slight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old woman didn't seem to be offended as she continued her explanation your daughter has been born with a unique condition my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whether it is advantageous or detrimental i do not know yet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and that condition caused her to almost die?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no it was the place where the lady gave birth that is to be blamed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and please don't interrupt let me finish.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old lady said exasperatedly seeing bromwyn acting up again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your daughter or rather her soul didn't come into this world alone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was tethered to another's even before the light of the disc saw her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was because the tether was stretched so thin that manna was continuously leaking from her body to repair it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn was confused i don't understand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder croneira thought for a while then asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you know of those high-level slave sigils used on other discs?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they say it is a much stricter form of the servants' sigil we use here.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it comes with many heartless restrictions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though what does it have to do with my daughter?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn asked back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your daughter was born with something similar to the slaves' sigil imprinted in her soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " closer to geist or spirit contracting sigils than slaves actually if i were to be accurate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the functions are similar without the restrictions for forceful obedience.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet one of those restrictions must've been about distance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she and her contracted were too far apart when she was birthed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we have moved them closer together now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hence she was cured.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " realization finally dawned on bronwyn's face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it didn't give him the peace of mind he wished for.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so my daughter is a slave now?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no a beast of burden for this other person this soul mage?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the elderly woman denied with vexation i doubt both of those my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " from what i have seen this sigil-like-tethernot any sort of soul manipulating magic goes both ways.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i reckon it occurred naturally.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " past cases testify to this at least.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before the two were brought closer together the other party was also at death's door.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however we might need to do some more auguries to better our knowledge of the situation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " truly?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then her well-being?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is assured my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " both the princess's and your wife's health has been improving.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it may be belated but please accept my heartfelt congratulations.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder croneira smiled at last.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if with that statement she had officially declared the crisis mitigated.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn shared her sentiment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his shoulders slumped down in relief the fatigue he had hidden behind a stone exterior burst out on his face before quickly morphing into unbridled joy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he almost slumped on the floor as he roared a cry in relief.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thanks to the manna oh spirits of the hundred thousand lakes custodian of our lives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " allow me my gratitude for my daughter is well!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few more breaths of happy outbursts later bromwyn noticed an important detail he had forgotten to ask.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with the gait of a clan chieftain that finally returned he asked through a grim voice and what of this other party?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who should i blame for almost taking her away from me?!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder croneira looked troubled at that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but she still firmly spoke out her thoughts no one my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a naturally occurring phenomenon as i have mentioned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a talent of sort for both parties similar to the martial spirits or soulbound armaments used on other discs yet in this case they are both dhionne.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though what results this tether ultimately brings remains to be seen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you may think of it as another cultivation root they were born with.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as for the other parties' identity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder croneira sighed then turned her gaze to the other two participants in the room.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " specifically the young man who had been listening to their conversation with a confused face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before bromwyn could punch the poor man's face in she continued.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stay your hands my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is not him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she paused confirming that the chieftain didn't go through his actions towards the man who somehow managed to look positively incensed rather than fearful at the clan chieftain's actions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but her following words simply shifted bromwyn's rage down a generation it's his newborn son.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " born a quarter-hour before the princess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 3 - dreams of a new life\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " get out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he said his voice as calm as a spring breeze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his right hand rested on the arm of the swivel chair while he tapped the mahogany desk with his left.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the analogue clock hung on the wall behind him ticked by the second hitting his composed fa\u00e7ade like a sledgehammer straight to his heart.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so thats it?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because of a single mistake you are kicking us all out?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman opposite him spoke out in anger.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her red ashamed visage created a gap with her tall explosive stature.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she dressed herself in a ruby red office dress with plum red lipstick and crimson glazed high heels.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but today that red was not the red of passion but the red of shame and guilt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all the other employees of his short-lived company watched on with trepidation through the glass walls as the lady in red and him went back and forth all but one young woman in a cute black trench coat sitting on a beanbag to the side while sipping on a can of beer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she sneered at sarahs shamelessness before glaring at the cooling unit of the outer office.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of all days the building management had to pick today to do maintenance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but of course her dissatisfaction went unnoticed by others who had far larger problems to worry about.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mistake?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so you mistakenly lied to the media gave them detailed stories that never happened and dried the dirty laundry of my sister houses for the whole world to see.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then you made a deal on behalf of my company with the guy who literally tried to steal our technology accidentally?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man said with no effort to hide the sarcasm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman turned her face away in humiliation but still tried to say her piece its just business there shouldnt be personal feelings involved.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " think of the potential of what i did please!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if played right which i will we can turn this start-up into a multi-billion credit enterprise in less than a few months!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we can compensate your sisters family with cold hard cash!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its all worth the results- the man scoffed you of all people know very well what i want and what i dont.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you went behind my back and turned this whole two-faced company against my own bloody family!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you made the media bring pitchforks to their doorsteps when they just want to live a quiet fucking life!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and you say that was fucking worth it?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " worth what exactly?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if you arent prepared to be ruthless then why even join the business world with a hot potato like that power source you invented?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you should at least hear mister jason out and then consider- the woman shook her hands frantically as she continued her self-justified explanation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but she was cut off by a loud drawn-out sigh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man rubbed his forehead trying to hold down a splitting headache.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you arent suitable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " none of you are.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you are just money-hungry bastards who dont give two cents about what the single-core should be used for.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all you do is go for the highest bidder regardless of the consequences regardless of my own damn opinion on the matter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you toyed with my aspirations and you know what hurts the most?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you lot fucking betrayed my trust in the name of it will be worth it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you think i am the same kind of person as you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sorry but i cant be such a hyena when there are better alternatives around.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he stopped the woman who was practically begging at this point sarah dont make me call the security.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will still pay you and your people the contracted amount.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and extra for terminating the contract early.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this company is done.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im tired i need a long rest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman went quiet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her face turned deathly pale at the realization that the man really was serious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her eyes began darting around in panic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had predicted some backlash but this was definitely not the result she or her actual employer ever hoped for.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was a gate closed not a business negotiation!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i-i can make it up to you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman brought out a piece of paper from her red handbag please i beg you dont misunderstand me im not the kind of person you think i am!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everything i did was for this company and for us and i made a mistake because i let my love blind me!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i let your love for me blind me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i know you also want to build a future where you and i can be happy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i-i actually always liked you too but i was always afraid you would reject me because i cant divorce my husband.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so i had to hide some things from you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i know my mistakes now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we can work this out together.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time i promise i wont make such silly mistakes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so please dont be hasty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " t-thats right come to my house tonight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lets think about what we can accomplish the unlimited funds for the future of your hard-built company!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you can do so much more with the money only i can make for you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you can build all the humanitarian technology you want if you just be a bit open-minded!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man patiently listened to her excuses for the last time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " seeing how she was so shameless till the very end he felt his heart shatter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how could i have been so blind ah.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he slowly swivelled his chair around facing away from the woman who now had tears and snot ruining her exquisite make-up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sarah... dont embarrass yourself any longer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont make me lose the last bit of respect i have for you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a girl of your talents can shine elsewhere without the need to sell your body or betray your husband so just go.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he closed his eyes refusing to entertain sarah any longer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " seeing that he had made up his mind she finally tore away all the fa\u00e7ades of earnestness she had put on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no longer was the tenderness of a coy woman there but a vengeful femme who had her desires wronged.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " youll regret this you know that right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you think youre the only hot shit on the market?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will see how many of those unrealistic utopian dreams you can pull off being so na\u00efve.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " theyll eat you alive this world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she spat out hoping to provoke a final reply.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but after a few minutes of silence sarahs shoulders slump.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it really was over and she knew it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and she wept.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she kneeled on the floor and cried hard for just one more chance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the man did not even look at her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he just sat there in his dark titanium chair thinking regretting ruminating.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he ignored all the pleading and grovelling the other former employees of his now-defunct company did after sarah had stormed out before they too gave up and left.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even after a few hours had passed he simply sat there with glossed over eyes sighing deep at what an absolute fool he was.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thud he was rudely jolted awake from his thoughts by a bamboo take-out box being slammed quite rudely on his deska logo of an animated chicken wearing a kimono winked at him the moment his eyes crossed that of the mascots.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who the fuc- the shock had finally pushed the man beyond his stress threshold for the day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was just about blast into a satisfying round of expletives when he looked up and witnessed the beautiful face of an angel no a succubus!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman was short petite even.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but had thick carves where she needed and deep valleys where she wanted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had a seductive shine on her sensual violet lips and a coquettish gleam in her foxy pink eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a lock of her wavy shoulder-length platinum blonde hair swayed in front of her face which she so daintily combed behind her small ruby-studded ears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that sexy denim blouse looking ready to burst open and those risqu\u00e9 heart-shaped hot pants with just enough skin and butt peeking out to give someone hope for an unforgettable night her smoky make-up and that spunky black chokerwhywhy why the hell is she wearing something so bloody indecent in my perfectly civil office room?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then he saw her angry pout and the sweat on her forehead and the trench coat tossed crassly on the sofa.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " right today was her date night with naomi.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man averted his gaze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but then smiled for the first time that day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this could be considered a small form of revenge.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she forced him to be a villain and he ruined her sexy time with her girlfriend.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tit-for-tat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this spicy pipsqueak who had inappropriately dolled herself up was the only person unfazed by what had just happened when it happened.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the only employee not to beg for a second chance because her entire being oozed a kind of confidence that when she wanted a second chance or a seventh chance the man could only bow his head and oblige her commands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because she was his bestest friend ever!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man affirmed that fact once more as he scrutinized that face he so desperately wished to never see again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eat up doofus.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " youre stomachs been rumbling like an angry kettle the last few minutes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she chirped with an irritating note sliding half of the bento in his direction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " youre still herei thought you left.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man muttered organizing his disorderly mind away for the anger and evil.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thank you by the way.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for telling me what they were up to.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man said but gratitude wasnt the only thing that reached his cloudy eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had more complex emotions seeing her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his saviour and his destroyer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as they like to say on that side of the yellow river without you i would have sold myself as a slave and would be counting the money for my sellers convenience.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he gave her a weak laugh before picking up a fried chicken with a spork.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chopsticks were too meta for his meagre abilities.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " enough of that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its my job.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the young woman rebuked with a mouth full of karaage chicken.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " which one?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this or the one for the intelligence agency?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he asked a bit of spite could not help leak into his voice even though he saw the goodwill behind her completely selfish actions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his heart was bitter and sour but the chicken tasted sweet and gingery on his tongue.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he chewed on it some more and the flavour of the beer batter finally assaulted his taste buds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " crunchy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " both!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and enough of that sulking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she sighed trying to poke the mans cheek with her oily chopsticks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she then asked as her feet dangled from his mahogany desk on which she so impudently sat so now what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are you really going to close store?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he answered frowning as he considered if he should push her off from his prized table.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he had worse things to worry about.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a bit of bone had someone gotten stuck between his teeth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he poked at it with his tongue until it freed before drinking a large gulp of water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am going to licence out the single-core to other companies or the state for that matter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman frowned at the revelation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " isnt that the same as what sarah tried to do?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she wanted to give the technology to an arms developer who would turn the single-core into a bomb that can blow up a city.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no matter how eco-friendly they promise to make their doomsday machine i want my stuff to have nothing to do with it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im going to put stringent and specific clauses on what the tech can and cant be used for.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so thats it then?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont trust myself enough to keep a reign on what a person with too much ambition will do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont trust people in general to keep their ambitions to themselves either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " better let the government handle all that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and besides he looked at the young woman again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she looked to be enjoying this synthetic meal far more than he was.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he winced when he saw her scoop out some wasabi paste with her finger and eating it raw.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " isnt a dissolution beneficial to you too?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats why you told me about all the backdoor deals sarah was doing in the first place.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so that you can spend less time babysitting me and more time with your spy bullcrap.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hells for the last time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am not a spy and it isnt crap.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its homeland security.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " she offered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man looked her in the eyes hard and long.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was the only one who reached out to help him in this cesspit full of traitors when she was the one that literally least needed to.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could give her some benefit of the doubt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man looked away right before the woman was about to blow her top.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " sure but im taking the beer then.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man smirked out a reply after grabbing both cans of kraft ignoring the young womans feeble yet cute protests.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that night he got so drunk that he got a hangover before even collapsing on the bed.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " his vision was still blurry but his mind instantly caught some anomalies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the air of the room felt rustic on his skin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ahhh my head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what a strange nightmare.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " fuck did the air purifier break down?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he tried to grab his aching head trying to reign in the migraine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but something small and soft slammed into his face with a thwack.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a loud cry of a baby from somewhere near him made his headache worse and his mind confused.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why would there be a baby on his bed?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " last night he really had drunk too much 60 lunar brew.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait sarah wasnt on the gigantomachy!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i fired her three decades ago!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he rubbed his temples trying to make some sense of his jumbled mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but this damn squishy thing kept thwacking him left and right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the crying was still going strong and now the thwacker was wet and slimy getting some sort of water goop all over his face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " go away!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he tried to yell out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but all that left his mouth was a waaaaah wahh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " waaaaait a minute he stopped his body stilling like a needle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his vision slowly cleared.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he concentrated on the thing that kept hitting him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a handpint-sized like a babys a bit pinkish too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but there was something wrong it had six fingers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the last one was like a thumb but grew beside what should be the pinky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his gaze followed the hand to figure out the hateful fella who kept slapping him only to find the palm joining with a forearm connected to the arm at the elbow and finally a shoulder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his shoulder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh he gasped and the crying stopped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only soft breathing remained.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he realized it was actually him who was crying.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " am i still dreaming?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he thought in bewilderment as he struggled to lift his head up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he couldnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was damn heavy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he couldnt stand either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his legs kept curling up above his belly no matter what he tried to do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his mind sank into a haze of mist.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it felt like his brain was frying every time he tried to think his current situation through.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he still tried.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was probably the most realistic lucid dream he had ever had and he was no longer enjoying being in it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " did someone plug me into a virtual reality pod?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so we didnt die.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was then that the memories of the blast returned in full force.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the pain of getting his every nerve overloaded with infinite random information surfaced as he found himself back into the core room of the gigantomachy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time though the whole structure was made out of solid light and kept fading in and out like a realistic illusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the heat seared his eyeballs the radiation mutated his innards.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the pain was too much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he screamed and passed out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he woke up again this time without the nightmares or the pains.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his mind was clear as water but his body was still uncooperative.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " where am i?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why am i a baby?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what happened to the gigantomachy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " did the collective get the data packet?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he said as he looked up at the stone ceiling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was a glowing stone stuck on there in the shape of a cloudthe soft light illuminating the room.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " suddenly he heard a squeaky voice speak from beside w-where am i?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why is my body so little?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wheres the weapon control?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i need to shoot down even one enemy fighter before i die!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he turned his head around with great difficulty to see another baby with an extremely distressed face looking straight at him with giant lilac eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was she by the rounded features of her face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he could be mistaken.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because the baby was honestly the weirdest toddler he had ever laid eyes on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " blue hairs like gently placed weaves of leaves topped her cute head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her skin was an unnatural hue of white like white paint or the blank canvas of a photo editing software.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it felt eerily out of place and the bluish blood vessels underneath that skin gave her an even more ethereal presence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to mention the deep blue tattoos that lined her face and body in an intricately drawn vine-like pattern.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she looked like a baby fished straight out of a fantasy game.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her glistening eyes kept a hold on his own gaze for a few more minutes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he felt strange emotions bubble gently in his mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were like faded sights sounds scents touch and tastes all together in one packaged bundle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " separate he would have ignored them as his mind playing tricks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " together they painted the picture of a specific person he was just about starting to miss.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " could it be?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he called out a name in an alien voice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the name of his best friend who should have died with him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other partys eyes stretched wide at the sudden call.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " far wider than naturally possible as a human.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the feeling in his mind turned static his best friends face overlapping with the strange blue and white baby.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then it started hurting.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh no not agaaaaiin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " an infantile scream escaped his mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the last thing he saw before passing out was a dark silhouette rushing towards him with a glowing apparatus in both hands and the other blue and while baby screaming twice as loud as his consciousness faded to black.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 4 - investigative grappling it was his third time waking up from blackness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time someone was swaying him tenderly while singing a soft tune in an unknown language.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shock from before slowly vanished with his newest bout of awakenness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he felt refreshed if anything.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whoever was humming the tunea lullaby he assumednoticed that he was awake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shadow fell away from his vision and he saw a young woman smiling lovingly at him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was whispering something in a strange sing-songy voice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or was it just the uniqueness of this maiden's language?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman had wavy hair the colour of tree barks a beige-green.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her golden eyes were slit like a reptile's but he saw no malice thereonly devotion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were several other abnormalities too such as her arms feeling strangely rough and grainy against his own skin but not uncomfortably so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman's skin looked virtually the same as an east asian's from earth to his human senses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however he was sure that whoever or whatever she was she wasn't a human.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he suddenly remembered the irregularities about his own body his chubby arms that kept trying to thwack himself and he was pretty sure that he wasn't a human any longer either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so then what was he?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what was his relationship with this woman?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he noticed he had a similar skin colour to hers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that wasn't enough information.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman had by then carried him back to a crib presumably the place he had first regained consciousness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she lightly rubbed his cheeks with her fingers and kissed him on the forehead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " '1 2 3.6 fingers.'\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few more seconds of unknown muttering later she was gone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " 'ah.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is that a common trait of these beings or is she possibly my mother or a relative?'\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he thought back on his deceased parents and found it hard to accept.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he corrected himself 'the mother of this body then maybe?'\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " while he was thinking a pair of squishy hands started kneading his cheeks out of nowhere.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he turned his head sideways to see the white and blue baby from before.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was lying prone on her belly facing towards him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their eyes crossed for a split second and she stopped kneading.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but then she ignored his questioning gaze and went back to stretching and pinching his facial parts again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stop that!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he growled in earth common.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it tickles!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and hurts!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she paid him no heed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few more tries later he tried to slap away the harassing hands with his own short appendages.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet alas it seemed he was born physically inferior to the assailant even as both were babies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i said stop!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " again no results.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time she infuriatingly booped his nose too before sniffing his ears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that's it you asked for it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he mustered up all the strength and knowledge he could in that quick breath of time and counter-attacked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and by counter-attack he rolled his body with great effort on top of the little tattooed scum-bag.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was finally her turn to feel distressed as the move was as sudden as it was unexpected.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it effectively locked her in position under his back and she soon started wheezing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " take that!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he beamed as he got the desired response out of the harasser.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " teach you to bully me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you think i can't do self-defence?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i went to the dojo four times!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however before he could feel any happier he felt the slithering touch of a group of slimy fingers fondling his body.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " 'oh no.'\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he thought waai- before he could surrender he broke into maniacal laughter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the laughter then turned into something like a frog croaking followed by erratic heaving coughs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it felt like literal centuries and before he gave up all control over his body to the demon in a baby's skin the tickle-torture stopped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he lay there breathing heavy and spasming with tiny twitches wondering why the woman from before hadn't come to save him from an apparent hostile force.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe he didn't laugh hard enough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait he was crying at the end wasn't he?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before he could get too comfortable lying down though the demonic hands returned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but this time they did nothing so impolite simply nudging his cheek till he gave up again and looked her way again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so she spoke at last do you think this is a dream?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you forced me through all that to find out if we are dreaming?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he asked in disbelief.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other baby nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why didn't you pinch your own cheek?!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he raged.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i did before you woke up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she replied a matter-of-factly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you!!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no we can't be sure about that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if whatever's happening is strange enough that it can bypass logical self-ques?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " let me do it so we can be as objective as possible.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now roll over!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he found strength like he never felt before in the few tens of minutes he was awake and made another enraged roll towards her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you can try!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she declared in equal parts amusement and challenge.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the struggle he anticipated didn't come.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even after smooshing her cheeks like she did his and launching his own tickling attack fueled by vengeance the girl only giggled a little but didn't resist.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before long his emotions were vented thoroughly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that and he found himself dead tired in that one minute of physical violence and his hands somehow ending up inside the girl's mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the baby girl licked his hand taking the chance and her eyes smiled into crescents.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ey.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he sensibly retracted his hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now that he was calm he felt weirdly inappropriate as if he had committed a sin in the heat of the moment that he should not have.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " back when they were adults this kind of interaction would result in a confusing relationship going forward.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet now before he could wallow in any more self-shame though she affirmed her earlier guess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hmm that definitely didn't wake me up if this were a dream.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i'm not really ticklish.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what about you?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he eyed her carefully for any signs of aversion and found none.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy fumbled out a reply hiding his face behind his palms ahh i don't think so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i'm still not awake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she laughed or we are awake and this is not a dream silly!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " y-yeah that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that's what i wanted to say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are you sure now?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he blushed anew as much as a baby could.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yup!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so let's not do any more baby fights please.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her childish laugh sounded strongly melodious in his ears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then mr man-of-objective-science do you think this is a virtual reality cabin of some kind?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i heard your friend sanada yukimura installed a- sakada sugimura.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and yes he did since a single-core is just about the only thing that can power that beast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i tried it for a test run on gigantomachy with some of the boys.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it certainly was the most advanced vr technology in the collective.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but.. it was nowhere near as realistic as all this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he rolled over till he was lying prone and gave the leafy bedding they were lying on a few deep sniffs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mmhm smells grassy and citrusy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he rolled again in the other direction until he could touch the fence of the crib.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it felt like wood on the touch of his fingers but he couldn't be absolutely sure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then turned towards the other baby who was now looking at him with a giggle on her lips.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he slowly stuck out his tongue keeping eye contact with the other party and gave the crib a lick.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hehe.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that got a snicker out of his attentive audience.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy conducted a few more investigative manoeuvres.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then announced his expert analysis this wood or the polish on top of it tastes bitter... and smokey.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he paused for a bit to think back on the memories of the virtual pod on the gigantomachy yup.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i'm sure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was no sense of smell or taste with this level of intricate details.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if we ignore sight hearing and touch which can be reproduced easier with the collective's current technology.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other baby turned serious at that conclusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unless someone grabbed our disintegrated bodies or cell remnants from deep space after the blast cloned or healed us and plugged us into a device far better in level than even the best of the collective's this allis real?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or the life before this was the lie and this has been the reality all along.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he replied with a mirthful laugh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she didn't respond to his lousy attempt at humour.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her expression shadowed over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i can't believe it.. she mumbled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we yeah i know it can be shocking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am having a hard time accepting it too leaving behind everything and everyone we ever knew and being stranded in this world without our friends or miramarja- he tried his best to comfort the curled up little girl even though he desperately needed someone to do the same to him too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet a loud cheer interrupted him we're aliiiive!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the hands of assault returned like a storm but without the harassment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before he knew it she rolled over and grabbed him tight in a hugan awkward yet fluffy hug because of the baby's insufficient motor skills but a warm hug nevertheless filled with joy and exhilaration.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we're alive!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she cheered repeatedly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your wish came true!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her bubbling force nearly overwhelmed him also his anxiety being thrown out of the window like an old rag he no longer wanted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he asked in the tangle of limbs y-yeah?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what wish?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the girl stopped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she stared at him for a few seconds from above then shook her head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i don't know?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i feel like i forgot something important.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he shrugged it happens when you get disintegrated into pure information and energy like that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not your fault.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the girl beamed nothing ever is is it?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before he could reply the girl pecked his forehead rolled over from above crashing onto the bedding beside him letting go of her worries.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you need to be more.. ahhhh-hhaaaaaawn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that was an enormous yawn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he smiled finding her shift in energy levels quite amusing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the boy then caught himself yawning just as loud.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " baby brains can't handle so much confused thinking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you overclocked our brains with all your analyses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ok stop glaring at me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " babies can't do grappling either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i'm sorry i manhandled you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he puffed hot air out from his nose and harrumphed in the other direction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but what she said made sense.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he felt like he had just finished a hundred kilometres marathon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shame.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there's more i want to investigate but that's enough thinking for now i guess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he yawned again then tried to roll over to a more comfortable position on the crib.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the fence was pushing against his upper arm which now felt sore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when he was back at his original position in the baby bed's dead centre she also rolled up next to him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one of her hands gently rested on top of his chest and the other linked with his own.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it didn't feel uncomfortable and he was too tired at this point to even complain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " soon after that the light breathing of two otherworldly souls was all that was left in that unknown spacious room.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 5 - beast taming\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thirty days passed in the blink of an eye.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they both learnt a lot of unusual things about their new homeworld in the meantime.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the most important thing in his opinion were the names.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or what he suspected were names.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ellie are you jinxing us?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he heard a squeaky voice chirp.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy who was referred to as ellie was currently trying to uncurl his baby legs consciously.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but his efforts were in vain as the two tiny appendages had been extremely uncooperative.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had read an article on some tabloids that in rare cases babies could walk before 3 months.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he hoped he could too but his hopes were meant to be dashed again it seems.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " show some respect!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and its not improbable see?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " our mothers take turns taking care of us but we never see our father.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you realize how these feudal societies work dont you?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he thought back on the other woman who would breastfeed them every other night whilst the first one with six fingers elrhains birth mother would take charge of their meals in all other times.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the first time this second mystery woman visited was a day after their initial investigative activities.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the bubbly leaf-headed young woman hugged elrhains mother hugged the servantshe assumed by their subservient behaviourshe hugged an elderly woman and finally hugged agwyn into a loving squeeze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that was the name of the other baby agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though agwyn was adamant in nicknaming themselves ellie and annie.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when agwyns mom realized she didnt have enough hands to hug elrhainbecause she was holding another of those glowing crystals with her right palmshe conjured a stream of water to pick elrhain up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even though elrhains own mother went pale in the face the curious boy didnt mind the magical embrace at all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if anything the water hug felt more refreshing than the stuffy physical ones.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then after putting agwyn down she held elrhain in her arms and showered him with ten minutes worth of snuggles and smooches.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that the woman had no legs horrified elrhain for a good few minutes but he soon lost his worries in the warm cooing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though from the corner of his eyes he could not help but glance at her robes where her knees should have been.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was only sloshing water there kept in the shape of a slugs lower half.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " freaky but nothing he could change to his own liking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain also noticed some discrepancies in agwyns mothers relationship with elrhains own.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the whole thing looked like a forceful one-sided sisterly bond with elrhains mother being quite wary and respectful of the slug woman initially.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hence a few days ago he suggested to agwyn do you think my mum is the concubine and yours is the principal wife?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that day agwyn didnt stop crying till she fell asleep in exhaustion her eyes nose and ears were still plump violet in anger the following day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was stunned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no matter how childlike their frames were their minds were still that of old bags of bones.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn should not have reacted like that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but considering that he also acted like a bona fide toddler sometimes without even his conscious control he put the mystery of their volatile psych in his ever-growing list of things to investigate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " today he had inadvertently brought the topic up again while practising his pathetic motor skills.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my crib neighbour ellie dear stop assuming things like that okay?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its rude!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " look at our bodies look at all these freaky disparities in our bodies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you really think we are half-siblings?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn complained while puffing up her cheeks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had been somehow crawling around the crib with her noodly body in an attempt to jump-start her carrier in physical sports.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " according to her crawling was a significantly more efficient manoeuvre to master at their growth stage than actual walking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he saw the logic in that but felt positively disturbed at not being able to do something as simple as a stand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " youre the one assuming not me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " people in this place have leaves for hair and water for legs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i wouldnt be surprised if one of our other siblings if we have any that is is a manticore or a charizard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain replied to her grumbles with mean logic of his own.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its not like he wanted them to be siblings.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but observations said otherwise.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had also reached the limit of bodily exertion for that day so he had nothing better to do than heave while lying flat on his back and push agwyns many buttons for some casual entertainment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but agwyn would not relent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she refused to step back and just go with elrhains teasing with this topic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you think that if they were fellow wives they would have such a good relationship?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in feudal societies back on earth people used to murder their fellow wives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe they do have a good relationship?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " otherwise why would they even raise us together like this?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even breastfeeding us in turns.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " t-that i do not know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn wore a dismayed expression as she stopped in her tracks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few seconds ago she was circling around elrhains fallen form like a drift car mocking him for being so weak.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that energy had left her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " speaking of breastfeeding elrhain looked at his motherit was still hard to accept the fact but not as much after a whole month of being washed and breastfed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the slit-pupil lady was walking towards their crib with some leafy towels a bucket of water and a few other necessities from their room entrance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she whispered in the strange language of this world what could only be expressions of adoration and picked him up by the armpits.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she cooed at him kissed his forehead and followed up with several other forms of motherly affection.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " on most days this lady would spend every waking minute beside their crib either weaving clothes out of unknown material or simply playing with the two kids till they fell asleep.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " today someone had called her away early in the morning after their first breastfeeding session.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whatever happened she looked mighty happy right now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains mother loosened her silky robes at the shoulder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he knew what was to come and he was numb to it at this point.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain thought back on the first day of this absolutely new experience wha- let go of me woman!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " help!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what are you doing?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait thats lewd.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its immoral i tell you-pfftmm elrhain struggled with all his baby might but that seemed to just excite the women even more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could swear he saw the womans golden slit-pupils turn pink.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had never been so humiliated in his life.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " logically he knew it was natural.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " emotionally he felt like he had sinned and he was sinned upon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to mention his own damn body betraying him at the most crucial moment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the moment his mouth touched the cherry tips of his mothers soft breasts it started sucking uncontrollably like a starved vacuum cleaner and his entire body relaxed into a melty cloud.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if the milk injected him with a dose of elephant tranquillizer in some heinous scheme to force him to suffer the indignity defenceless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after what felt like a week-long torture session the young mother giddily laid her son down on his tiny prison.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you seemed to be enjoying yourself agwyn harrumphed but her voice also leaked a strange sense of glee.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he couldnt tell if she was making fun of him or was feeling salty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " y-you wouldnt know!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i-if you ever tell anyone about this thenwait.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he stopped eyes wide.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then the just dishonoured boy smirked with mirth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other baby asked in confusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she got her answer when the elated woman gently picked her up into the same position elrhain was just in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hold on a bloody minute youre not even my damn mother-pfftmmmph ah now we both share this dirty secret.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he watched on in equal parts glee and shame as his breast friend was defiled right before his glistening eyes by none other than his own mother.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lunchtime was over and elrhain watched his skittish mother fidget around the room like a headless pigeon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hed never seen her this nervous and hed seen her nervous practically every other day over the past month.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he asked agwyn what do you think is going on?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe someone special is visiting?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she keeps looking at the door.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she answered and no sooner did the door in question open wide with a large gust of wind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyns mother entered the room with a loud exclamation while skipping with her slug shaped legs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she slid past her entourage and scooped both the infants up into a squishy cuddle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain who became dizzy after a short merry-go-round by the reckless slug woman sensed a large shadow lumber over his tiny form.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he felt a shiver run down his spine as an unmistakable premonition of doom washed over him and his eyes and arms involuntarily grabbed towards his weak-legged mother.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the unreliable woman was fidgeting by the wall with watery eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this traitorous- wait hold on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now that he looked carefully she had a more reverential if slightly fearful look on her face as she looked in his general direction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no she was looking behind him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " past the fluttering hair of agwyns mother stood a man straight out of a barbarian fantasy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had long braided hair and a vikings beard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his eyes glowed lilac and nostrils flared with fire.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the barbarian wore no upper clothing revealing the bulging muscles and the symbols throbbing all over them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they pulsed with fury both the muscles and the symbols.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they promised violence and absolute dominance on elrhains barely one-foot form.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little boy felt the sweat on his back trickle down like a cascade and a salty taste assaulted his taste buds almost making him vomit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the bubbly voice of agwyns mother faded into the background as his eyes crossed with the hulking predators.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the barbarian squinted his teeth biting at his lower lipsthe braided beard menacingly swaying in the air.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " m-momma.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he tried to speak but his voice came out empty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain tried to turn his head around but found it stuck in position by an invisible vice grip.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he did the only other thing he could do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he screamed then peed his pants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain lay down on the crib with a fresh pair of pants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his eyes reflected his empty souls as the boy just stared up at the glowing rock on the ceiling searching for answers as to why the actions of someone has unintended consequences on others.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " pfft y-you peed in her breasts ahaha!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i thought we practised holding it in!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hells why doesnt this world have a video recorder?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn was literally rolling on the crib giggling her guts out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had fared far better in that encounter with the troll than he had.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hmph elrhain snorted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she didnt see what he saw.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was safe in the crib all the while he had to oppose blood-lust head-on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was like waking up in the middle of the night to find the boogeyman staring right at him just a thousand times scarier.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at least the boogeyman was imaginary.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the beastly snarl on that mans face was real.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well the snarl had now morphed into an apologetic expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the barbarian in question was currently kneeling on the floor.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the servants had already been ordered to leave the room while elrhains mother took care of the messy aftermath.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyns mom had punched the barbarian in the guts after that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain didnt even know why he was so afraid.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if earlier the man had a face like elrhain stole his last cookie and owed him a billion credits right now he sounded like a kicked puppy getting scolded after chewing through all 15 pillows in the house.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he saw the man stand up after agwyns mother finished delivering her stern piece.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains mom was standing on the side with an awkward expression on her face not interfering with the slug woman and big guys one-sided feud.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man soon loomed over the crib again his face perplexed and unsure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now that elrhain watched closely the barbarian was covered in tattoos similar to agwyns.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hes your dad elrhain said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " looks like it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why is he making faces at you?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you should have seen the look on his face earlier.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he grumbled back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with hands more enormous than their bodies the barbarian very carefully picked agwyn up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like she was the most fragile thing in the world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn giggled deciding to reward the man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and it worked like medicine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man broke into a shit-eating grin and those watermelon-sized eyes of his melted like they were made of candy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he whisper-shouted something excitedly and agwyns mother rushed to his side the fury all gone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she taught him how to hold agwyn in different ways and he listened like a filial disciple.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " soon after the man was guffawing merrily with his daughter giggling in his arms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the more agwyn did something anything the more the man changed from a prairie wolf to a domestic pug.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ah hes been tamed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain thought.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he once read an article in a weekly fathers magazine on how most fathers were biased towards daughters especially if the girls were born late.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it seems this was the case here too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " presuming they were siblings of course.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but maybe i can.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he contemplated for a bit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn made some more cute baby noises to let her parents know she was tired.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was extraordinary how expressive her baby-speak could be at conveying complex emotions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her mother smacked the big guy on the shoulder and gestured him to put agwyn down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the big guy obeyed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he tugged the fluffy fur pillow under agwyns head but then the man went on to look at her with a gaze full of yearning.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain saw the perfect chance the void in the barbarians heart and made his sinister move.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he made eye contact with agwyn and the other baby guessed right away his motifs and scooted over to the side.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just when the man was about to retract his hands from the cribs fence elrhain grabbed a large pinky with his tiny fingers and cried agoo!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a strategy that always got his mothers pupils to turn heart-shaped he did not feel like he would fail against the man-shaped doggo.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and he was right!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the mans eyes first turned wide in shock!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked startled and his eyebrows squinted extremely hard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked at the five tiny fingers tenderly hugging his pinky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his expression morphed from confusion then fear and finally to absolute amazement.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " aiyaaa elrhain struck on pretending he was a cute chubby cupid in a cuteness simulator.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he tried to grab the man with his other hand too but lost his balance and clumsily fell over with a yelp.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he quickly sat up again and turned his watery eyes upwards right through the big guys eyes to his softest heart.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains hands searched for something to hold but found no destination.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and with that large droplets of tears started tumbling from his eyes as he sobbed like a wronged daughter-in-law.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man looked at a loss.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he turned his gaze towards his wife whose eyes were smiling into crescents.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyns mom called over elrhains own with a soft whisper.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other woman had seen what happened and her face was beaming too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she still looked a bit reserved when speaking with the larger man yet it did not stop her from pointing at his pinky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man slowly extended his smallest finger towards elrhains outstretched palm his face masked with nervousness and anticipation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain didnt disappoint.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hook line and sinker!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a silent few seconds followed his third baby-squeak kyaan and the man burst into another round of boisterous laughter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he picked up elrhain like his wife showed him earlier and tossed him up in the air.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two women blanched but the big guy expertly caught elrhain without even the slightest discomfort.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then up and down again and again he played with the little boy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it reminded elrhain of the thrill rides back on earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he quite liked those.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he giggled away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " gradually he found himself in an uncontrollable fit of laughter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " another natural reaction of this body he assumed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he didnt mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it made his cute act feel genuine instead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " soon he too grew tired.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he yawned mightily and the barbarian finally put him to rest on the soft crib bedding just as gently as he did with agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he whispered a few more sweet nothings to them both and then being pulled by agwyns mother left the room with the ladies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so agwyn asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what do you think?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " did you see how they both followed him out the door?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im telling you they are all married!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn slapped him hard and refused to talk for the rest of the day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 6 - secrets of baby speak\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " did you see how valiant he was!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how he communicated seamlessly with our daughter with nothing but eye-glances?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn the current chieftain of the earthloch clan and the proudest father and father-in-law on the disc exclaimed boisterously while walking down the hallway.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes honey.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for the fifth time we did.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his wife cyra lou earthloch replied in exasperation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was one thing about her husband that really ticked her off.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " once excited this fellow would talk about the same topic over and over again until the listeners ears were bleeding.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he made the warriors promise to me!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and he doesnt even know what it is.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the chieftain said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he slammed his fist on his pecs a true man!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if he has pitiful potential no son-in-law of the earthlochs will stay like that forever.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the way bromwyn turned towards elrhains mother with the tone of his voice shifting eluned was it?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why are you still draped in a servants garb?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the petite woman looked unsure how to answer that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i... my lord ive been wearing this most of my life.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont know what else to.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " preposterous!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " youve had your sigil removed no?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hunter dofnald will also finish the blood quenching of his totem blade any day now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we have given you the right to a surname for a month already!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i expect you to live up to that honour.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this he moved his hand up and down towards the nervous eluned is shameful.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned didnt know what to do so she instinctively bowed her head and apologized.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn facepalmed you you are a noble houses matriarch now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " any more subservience is- he was about to go on another tirade when his wife at last interrupted him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now now be nice to her dear.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she is our in-law.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " besides do you think you can suddenly wear noble garbs like the yuriels do if by chance our title increases?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn found it painful to breathe just thinking about it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " those tight clothes covering their entire body.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and not even armour!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he shook his head frantically.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra smiled then looked towards eluned warmly eluned my dear follow me to my chamber after this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ive already told the watches so you dont have to keep watch on the kids this afternoon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we have so many things to discuss you and i. and since you can take your time learning the etiquette of nobles you should at least put in the effort to show us you are changing no?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned found it hard to refuse the soft-spoken cyra.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the chieftainess after seeing eluned nod hesitantly clapped her hands in joy perfect!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she then led the confused former servant to her chamber before bromwyn could begin his tirade on the valiant elrhain for the sixth time that day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ive noticed something.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain suddenly said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn paused her movements.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was practising jumping on all fours.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " over the previous month her stamina had improved tremendously and she was eager to try out new physical skills.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain on the other hand gave up after day four much to agwyns disdain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when he told her i heard exercising as babies stunt growth she practically spat on him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then she saw the logic in his words.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the reminder also stopped agwyn from over-exerting her tender muscles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie can you sing me a song?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he made the strange request with an earnest gaze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn wanted to ask why but didnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was sure shed have the answer soon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and she had in fact been missing music a lot lately.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " coughcough dont get your hopes up okay?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i havent practised singing at all since since we died.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " will any song do?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was feeling rather shy to perform after so long but didnt want to let elrhain know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his face was the image of concentration as his eager eyes met hers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so she began twinkle twinkle little star .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .. what you are!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and stopped after completing the nursery rhyme.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she turned her glittery eyes towards him in expectation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " huh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what you say?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was surprised.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn pounced on him with an inaudible screech.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wha-!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait i have a good reason!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the time she let go elrhain had scratches all over his face hands and neck.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " explain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that was all she said before retreating.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but her eyes promised that if she was not satisfied by the answer the bloodshed would continue.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain squinted rubbing the places that got scratched to lessen the pain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ouch you resort to violence too easily or were you actually taking advantage of me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you know thats a real turn off -wait!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " geez stop hitting me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ill explain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you remember the first time we woke up here?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn nodded grumpily.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " weve been speaking to each other in front of our mothers all the time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you ever wonder why they dont find it strange two toddlers having such long conversations?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no matter how unknown the language or how undeveloped our vocal speech is they should at least realize its a language.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unless they are that dumb.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she nodded repeatedly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but they dont.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now i think i know why.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that got her full attention.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had already expected this charade to be one of those peculiar investigations he had been doing for the past month.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like trying out all the harry potter spells to see if they worked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they didnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the first time we woke up there was this blaring static in our heads like someone was blaring a broken bullhorn in our brains and it was really hard to speak or think.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but now that blare is long gone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie i want you to guess what im thinking about right now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uhh dog alien comet suicide forest amazon trainforest ahh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all correct!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay we need to try this a few more times.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was positively thrilled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was the first real controllable contact they had with the supernatural.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they tried numerous other things and almost every time they could divine what the other was thinking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " frankly it was starting to creep elrhain out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then to his absolute joy wrong!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain cried in the middle of one test.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " huh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt the norwegian butter crisis?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn asked with a squint in her eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nope!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was the unflooding of the netherlands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time i wasnt actively trying to transmit my thoughts to you so you got it wrong!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he replied with a cheer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that means we still have privacy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what would we need privacy for?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn asked in trepidation her eyes glossed over into an unnerving look.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain started before strongly rebuking her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agent annie you are going down an extreme path of no return.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " autocracy is never the answer!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lets get back on topic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he wiped off the sweat from his forehead as agwyn glared back and continued with his deduction this link that we have.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we can somewhat jam it if we concentrate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and that fact has the answer to why mother never considered us demon babies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he cleared his throat just as agwyn had a few moments ago this time i will sing and halfway through i will try to restrict the link.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are you ready?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " can you sing never gonna give you up?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn perked up the rage she felt was all but forgotten at this point and was replaced with anticipation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sure why not?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay here goes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " were no strangers to loove.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you know the rules and so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn started clapping along with the famous rhythm but then something weird happened.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agoo da di ughy angaa goo.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she first thought something was wrong with her hearing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the guchi goos continued!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stop!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she screamed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked like a hyper-excited baby bouncing up and down as he got too into the song.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the tone and the sounds were completely wrong!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when she realized that elrhain wasnt stopping she tackled him down pushed her palms on his mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stop!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain calmed down from the high at agwyns high handedness then bobbed his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn slowly removed her hands before asking was that what we really sound like?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yup!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if either of us stops the link we wont be able to understand each other.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at least until we learn this worlds language.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this mental link do you think we can speak telepathically?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lets find out!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now do this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl closed her eyes and concentrated according to elrhains instructions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now that she knew what to look for indeed there was this strange tunnel?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " leading away from her head into the infinite void of the mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you see it dont you?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that tunnel-like structure in our mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats the best part!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to answer your question i dont know if we are telepathic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but just think of the possibilities the very fact that we have in-built magic in our heads opens up so many new doors!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who knows what else kind of psychic stunts we can pull with this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the way does the structure in your mind look familiar to you?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time elrhains face turned serious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now that you mention it it kind of looks like the comm line app icon?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but not quite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " theres so much fog... as i thought its not just me being nostalgic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he shook agwyns shoulder to wake her up from her trance you think we brought this with us when we crossed over?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyns eyes turned wide in realization the blast!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the gigantomachy!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lets not get our hopes up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we still have a lot to research.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " youll stop forcing us to waste time playing bodybuilder and cooperate right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my dearest friend of four exciting decades did you come up with all this just to quit exercising?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn asked with an exasperated sigh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wha- is that how you see me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im trying to be honest here!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this could be the answer to every question we had over the past month and possibly reveal the mysteries of the universe!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i would like never- i get it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you dont have to say any more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn shook her tiny head her face clouded with disappointment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im absolutely not lying.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked offended so much so that agwyn suspected he had practised making that very expression while she was not aware.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " forget it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whatever your motivations are the results are what matters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she mumbled under her breath.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " exactly!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though i still think you misunderstand something about my integrity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they spent the rest of the day testing out various possibilities.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains list was exhaustive.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would take the better part of another month considering their baby stamina to complete everything he could think of right at the top of his head not to mention the constant stream of new things to try out that barraged his mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they didnt even remember their nightly meal or when elrhains mom returned since they were so groggy in the magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the next day agwyn was in a contemplative mode.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when elrhain asked what was wrong she just smirked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " did you see what your mother was wearing yesterday?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ah that was animal fur and hide right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this world is kind of primitive.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it looks kinda lewd.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " also have you seen any metal-wares since we arrived?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only wood stone bones and clay.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats not the point.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was wearing the same thing as the other maids.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn hinted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are we still talking about that?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " does it actually matter?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she could be the wet-nurse concubine for all we know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain said annoyed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before agwyn could scream blasphemy at him and go into a lengthy explanation on the whys it most definitely mattered the door to the room opened up and the lady in question bounced in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she donned a silky shawl over a pristine white fur robe that reached her ankles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain face-palmed feeling extremely tired.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn threw the pillow out of the crib furious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman looked bewildered at the blue babys sudden aggressive behaviour.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still her eyes moved on to her own son who was trying to do a baby version of an it is what it is shrug.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she smiled and hummed a gentle tune.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or was she just speaking?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it could have just been the singsong language.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could never really distinguish when she was speaking or singing a lullaby.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the bed under him vanished as he went deeper into the thought.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was picked up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he assumed it was already time for feeding so he closed his eyes and made a suckling motion with his mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hed been getting awfully hungry with all the scientific thinking he had been doinga far cry from his initial reaction of horror and then numbness to the event.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he actually looked forward to it now his brain needed the sustenance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " contemplation was hard work after all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the sweet nectar and the touch of the soft cherry never came.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he felt his body turning sideways then rotating clockwise while he was left-side-up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what the..!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he finally noticed something was wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt his mother who had picked him up but an unfamiliar young man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the stranger had light brown hair and deep blue eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the face was clean-shaven with the curly hair on his head glistening like some italian shampoo models.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the only irregularity elrhain could discern at a glance were the mans bangs which were of slightly different colour the dab grey of stone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the young man also protruding fangs like a vampire.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was currently looking over elrhain like he was a commodity in the transylvania juice market whether or not elrhain had any defects.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the irritated little boy felt like throwing up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had been upside down for a second too long and the rough treatment was getting on his nerves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he did all over the mans frowning face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " blergh he heard the loud voice of the woman coming from somewhere and regretted it immediately.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if the man let go and elrhain turned into a baby pancake?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the man didnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his grip which was considerably gentle now that he noticed didnt even flinch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was no longer sideways so he didnt have trouble looking straight into the mans eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was no uneasiness or disgust there.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only the slight crunch of the nose probably because of the smell of the retch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not knowing what to do elrhain just repeated his earlier strategy with the barbarian agoo?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man tilted his head not even bothering to wipe away the vomit all over him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that was until elrhains mother brought a leafy rag from somewhere and wiped them both clean while very clearly complaining.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ah i got some on myself too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his mother was giving the man the stink eye as she removed the confused baby from his hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man just scratched his head awkwardly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when they were both removed of almost all the stains the woman shooed away the man towards the door very rudely.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she sounded pretty angry when she saw him flipping and angling agwyn over like he did elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the baby girl had handled herself far better though as was always the case with her and x-treme sports.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was a one-sided heated exchange from the young lady and finally reluctantly the man relented.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he gave one last pat on elrhain and agwyns head and was about to leave.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but then he looked as if he recalled something and suddenly turned around.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain watched on in awe and shame as the young man simply walked up to the fussing young mother and planted a long deep kiss on the ladys plump rosy lips.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one breath two three twenty three hundred and fifty elrhain stopped counting.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even a frenchman would blush in shame.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little boy shied his eyes away desperately trying to hide a twitch of embarrassment at what the adults were doing in the presence of two highly intelligent babies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bravo!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn on the other hand cheered hysterically.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if she could whistle she would have done so until she got arrested for indecent conduct.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and dont say this is an affair!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i wont believe it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you have the same eyes and grey bangs as that wonderful man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain didnt respond.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his gaze just followed the back of the confident man out of the room.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all that he left behind was a scene of carnage elrhains furiously blushing mother fumbling about her tasks with fidgety fingers weak knees and a wistfully in-love gaze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 7 - window to another world\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why are we so small?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn peered out of the window towards the bright blue sky with a pouty face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the warm rays of sunshine licked her scrunched-up nose like a spotlight on her adorable smallness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont want to be small anymore!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain sat beside her squinting his eyes at some strange flying creatures in the sky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had wings like a bat but paws like a cat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it means we get to live longer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy mumbled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she didnt want to hear that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ahhhh she screamed loudly as she threw the pillow out of the crib with surprising force.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains mother was practising some strange dance in the middle of the room and the pillow hit her square on the bosom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman reeled at the sudden hit before staring at agwyn with bewilderment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl felt terrible about that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this pillow throwing habit should be rid of before it could turn worse.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but theres absolutely nothing to do!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i cant see any more improvements no matter how much i train in this damned crib i want to go out and run i want to play with my plasma-lance!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i wanna swiiiiim ahhh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who was it that called me hasty when i wanted to stand up without learning to crawl?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other baby smirked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she wished she could punch a hole in his charming face but then she wont be able to look into those dreamy eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i thought wed grow up in no time!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ten months ago it was summer and it still is.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " exactly how far from the star is this bloody planet?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she pouted harder as if that would solve all her problems.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it did back in her previous life when she was a cute little girl her parents favourite princess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well people living in norway aged no slower than everyone else.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so i dont see how longer seasons can affect our lifespan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will guess it would be the genetics then and not if summer is longer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but maybe it does depend who knows.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain shrugged.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn always felt jealous of how a little intrigue could satisfy him so much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he wouldnt complain as long as he could mentally analyse some new aspect of this world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she on the other hand needed physical activities.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a habit ingrained in her soul for 75 long years.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " first as an interest later for training and her career and finally as an excellent hobby of combat sports.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she went through more forms punching another human than she could poke a stick at and now it was coming to bite her in her violet peachy bottom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn slapped the flab on her tummy in annoyance hey how old do you think we are in earth terms?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " pre-genetic-enhancement?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my best guess is a month.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain dodged her legs as she kicked them up and down in frustration.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a week after i was born i think?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i measured my body.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if my head started on this stick of the cribs fence then my curled legs ended squarely on this one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn half-closed her eyes thinking of the many weird experiments elrhain had devised because of sheer boredom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain slapped one fence bar where his head started and pointed to another.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his toes now went a little past the indicated stick.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his legs were still curled though.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " meaning he grew.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but only slightly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i want to hover skate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn groaned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i also want to eat meat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or vegetables rice fruit or anything else solid.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain groaned with her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn smiled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " food was about the only thing the other baby complained about these days.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn didnt feel the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these last few months she felt like every day was the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " get up bother elrhain get fed try to exercise listen to elrhain talk about what he discovered that day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then came the feeding again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " let herself be harassed by her or elrhains father or mother or all of them at the same time then complain about all the unfairness a baby must face drink milk for the last time and go to sleep after pecking elrhain on the cheek.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she needed to invent another phrase for super-boring because she didnt know if her current one watching weeds grow was up to the task.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but today was different.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn crawled to where elrhain was sitting near the edge of the crib facing the window.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was a simmering rectangle of runes on the window frames.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn could guess their uses and it was... fascinating she heard elrhain say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she agreed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the constant prattle of heavy rain outside brought a calmness like no other to her mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she could feel the icy touch of the humid wind and hear the cacophony of frogs and insects out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet no rain came in the water droplets rolled down the window plane like they hit glass.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but there was nothing there.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the servant who set up those runes also did something to the crib.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it felt warm and cosy like she was constantly being hugged by her mother.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the protection on the window and the crib didnt stop the refreshing flow of the moist rainy wind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this is the life.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn almost melted into the fluffy pillow.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you think the year passed?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she asked the other baby.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or the season.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in some regions back on earth they divided the calendar into six seasons.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if this is the monsoon then it should come after summer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then again this is a fantasy world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn used her tiny fingers to count thats 1800 days to a year then?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yeah well we are assuming the number of days a month is like earths.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe in this world its 120 days a month.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or summer is divided into bright and dark parts like in the earths arctic winter with each being as long as a normal season.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ughhhh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she snatched away one of elrhains pillows and pressed her face against it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " winter isnt ending!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn looked up at the dusky sky behind the curtain of snowfall.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her body felt a chill and she curled the fluffy blanket up tighter around her body.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she felt like a kitten and she was not happy about it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if she counted by earth time-spans then the sky had been like that for two whole years.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it looks like the long days and nights of the arctic i dont even think this planet is orbiting any sun.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or if it is then there should be multiple.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain spoke with a sigh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn grumbled and agreed but she didnt have to like it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " speaking of suns.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the window in their room never showed any sun or suns directly but they could see multiple moons and the infinite stars at night.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you think that because of this weird day and night cycle?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i guess a single sun would be hard-pressed to fuck the seasons up so bad so randomly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she asked with a purr even if she could deduce the answer herself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she simply wanted to hear elrhain speak.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy had gone quieter since the snow started falling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the first ten months of this cold season was normal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then it was like midday for one earth year.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after that it was dusky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its been eleven months and the sky is getting darker.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the next earth year should be like the night sky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then what happens when the sun rises again?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " will it stay like the dawn?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain had a melancholic look on his face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn sure hoped not.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that would be apocalyptically tedious for her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont want that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well well see.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other baby shook off his foul mood and crawled up to her side.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he squirmed into the fluffy blanket like a small ferret seeking love and warmth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she felt his heat warming her as well as his soft hands wrapped her up in a tight burrito hug.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn smiled hang on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " theyll be here soon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she heard a sleepy growl.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she knew the cold was affecting elrhain far worse than her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but not all was bad.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her feet reached a few longer on the crib fences now and they had long uncurled their legs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but even she felt too lethargic to start practice walking right away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even though she knew she could if she tried.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the other good thing was- agwyn!----eat----elrhain-----milk food!---mother-- agwyns mother came in holding a steaming pot full of delicious stew.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few servants followed behind her with the other dishes and necessities like bowls cups and plates.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the barbarian her father followed behind with a bearded old man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains mother came in last.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had grown plumper by the seasons.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his father the romantic young man had last visited 2 months or 60 earth days ago before disappearing to god knows where.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she kind of missed the young man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his straightforwardness with elrhains mother was so consistently interesting.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was keeping notes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was preoccupied with other things.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had once wondered if agwyns moms lower half would turn into ice if winter came.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was curious too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet even as the weather grew colder with the darkening of the skies her watery legs remained flowing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eiiigh she felt elrhain make another unintelligible noise.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when his face came out of their burrow of blankets he was smiling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn shared his happiness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the smell of the food was mouthwatering.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it had been a while since they started eating food other than their mothers milk.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn felt half her depression and anxiety melt away like ice on a volcano on that fated day the moment she sipped the sweet juice of that purplish lemony orange thing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " gulp!!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain spoke with some mashed meat in his mouth he had no trouble chewing with his tender baby teeth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the beings of this world must have soooo many more taste receptacles active!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it always blows me away this depth of flavour.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn agreed and gave her own opinion imagine what would happen if they actually knew there were spices other than common herbs and salt!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont tempt me you little devil.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain chided her as he tried to swat away the barbarians finger from his cheek.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he currently sat on the elderly mans lap.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " while it was her mother who was feeding agwyn one finger-full at a time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains mommy had taken up the duty of adding ingredients from the stewing pot to each of their bowls and plates.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if she ignored the servants then this would be the perfect family meal of rural society.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its so unusual.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain suddenly said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she swallowed the soft starchy mashed vegetable in her mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her weak teeth still had trouble chewing anything more complicated than pudding unlike elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she looked at the approaching spoon of broth in instinctive anticipation the anticipation of when she too could chow down on meat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she once tried to drink the soup from an unsuspecting bowl left on the side on her own the meaty chunks were just too tempting.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the heat hurt her tongue gums and everything so bad she didnt stop crying until she fell asleep in exhaustion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this food is so rich and flavourful all this lean meat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i bet it is packed full of nutrients way above a human infants safe limit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " normal babies would have so many problems.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if these tribal people are being over-enthusiastic and?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn didnt share his concerns we age at least eight times slower than pre-gene-modded humans back on earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and we arent as inactive as turtles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i say this is another one of the bright sides of this boring world youve been listing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " would be nice if true.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but im willing to bet my collection of glowing socks that this world is anything but boring.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait till were older.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im going to re-enact the lord of the rings if its the last thing i do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn imagined the scene in her head and giggled out loud.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they didnt know what the adults were speaking except a few prevalent words but they looked merry as always.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the grumpy grandpa smiled now and then when elrhain tried to appropriate more meat for himself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their family didnt always come for meals like this and they didnt always eat so much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " perhaps once a night every few days.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it cheered her up so much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she hoped they would come more often.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " why do you talk funny?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked her in almost fluent uorian.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " it shouldnt exist this awful sound.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she shot back in earth common.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain shrugged and her mood worsened even more.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " it just better fits the biology of these dhionne than a traditional language from earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " want to practice with me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " fine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she hated how easy she was.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain thought for a bit before saying ive noticed this but you dont always get the sounds incorrect.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only occasionally.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like you say thuns and suns in the same sentence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn made confused baby cries.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay so we gotta start from the identification step first.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lets see if your lisp learned or natural.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn wasnt a poor learner.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in fact she was considered highly perceptive.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in her former life she had graduated from top academic establishments with flying colours even without the help of her influential family.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she knew nine variants of common including the dialects from east asia oceania central europe india and beta-00 asteroid belt colony districts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a prerequisite for her line of work.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet now i gib up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she tumbled onto their new bed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it felt considerably fluffier on her skin than the crib.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was about seven times larger too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she wished to shout her favourable impressions about the bed out loud to tell cyra and eluned how much she adored this new furniture.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the legs of the bed were pretty with carved runes and painted glyphs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but all that came out of her squished mouth were phwaffiness and yeg.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ey dont let it bother you too much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " most kids with speech impediments get over it by their early teens.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain scratched his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had conducted a series of tests on her funny-talk problem and decided it was nothing to worry about.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that it would just get better with time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then again no dhionne word sounds the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the extra vocal organs also increase the number of phonetic sounds we can make.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it will get better with practice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she wanted it to get better right now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn knew she had it in her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for example she could say words like daddy!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " fine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but sometimes when she tried to say dog it turned into gog.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " emulation became a whistled memulation and ellie turned into an adorable ewwie!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn punched the cushion with all the rage of an angry hamster just thinking about it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at this point she didnt even know if she was just mad about the situation or simply membarrassed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ahhh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn muffled a shriek.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she felt her dignity as a 75-year-old senior break down to pieces.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no its a hundred and five.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it took us thirty earth years to go from a baby to a toddler!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thirty years and i cant even speak this effing language.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the way she suddenly thought of an important question she just had to ask despite all her huffing and puffing have you finished learning the uorian letters?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was now elrhains turn to feel gloomy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these dhionne make traditional chinese look like a piece of cake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i cant figure out if they are like inuit languages such as inuktitut syllabics cuneiform or hieroglyphics.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are they poly-synthetic?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or simply like the old english and pretending to be arabic?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and why the hell do i have to know magic to learn letters?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you get my pain now dont you ellie?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn asked with a knowing grin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " would you say our pain is the same when i suffer from a language that uses both an abugida and an alphabet while you cry after pronouncing language as langoonu?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked positively offended at the very notion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn pouted not understanding what an abugida was.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if the other kids bully me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you can break stone bowls to pieces like it is a biscuit!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain threw his palms up in the air.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then he frantically shook his hands in front of his face but dont do that to the bullies!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if they beat me up in revenge when they cant fight you!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i wont okay?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i was just worried i wont be able to make any friends.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats whats bothering you?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked dumbfounded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yup.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in our previous life we really flopped up on our social skills right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time i want to make some real friends without all the backstabbing and boot-licking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn scrunched up her nose as she recalled all the time her trust was broken by so-called companions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and not just friends she had a horrible eye for lovers too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its like she went out of her way to find the sleaziest scum-bags to fall in love.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well good luck i suppose.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your dad looks like he is someone important like your mother from our previous life.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats bound to attract some opportunistic folks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even i dont want to meet someone like naomi again because everyone is lusting after your family influence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy shuddered at the very notion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn couldnt fault him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her girlfriend of six years had been the worst kind of asshole imaginable the kind that forced you to choose between love friends and family.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and she had been blind to it all until reality stabbed her in her sides.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whats worse is naomi almost ruined her relationship with elrhain and her mother.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " actually things were pretty awkward between her and her best friend for a few good years after that event.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn shivered in disgust and hurriedly pushed her mind away from that nightmarish past.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " speaking of my dad she said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wasnt he supposed to visit us today?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned even dolled us up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn moved over closer to elrhain and patted his shiny cheeks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned had put some sort of magical makeup on them both after a good round of washing and bathing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the powder caused her white skin to look less jarring and made elrhains honey-coloured skin sparkle like real honey.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn had to stop herself hard from licking him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they also both wore matching clothes made of beautiful leaves and animal fur.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had little tiaras on their head made out of some kind of bone and shiny sapphire bracelets that clinked on their arms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their attires were white blue and olive.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyns robe looked like a frock tutu and had nicely scribbled runes along the hem.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain on the other hand wore a simple tunic and trousers with similar magical rune-things.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he said that robes were too baggy and he felt unsafe in them without good olfashioned pants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn couldnt guess why.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had no trouble running around and doing cartwheels in hers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yeah even mother is all pretty today elrhain said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her dress looks like a greek chiton right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn scrutinized the woman from afar.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned had stopped engraving the shells since a while ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now she just squatted there knees together with both hands resting on her cheeks looking on and off at the door.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn suddenly saw eluned jerk up as she discussed how this primitive tribe could turn leather into silky smooth clothes.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the door to the room opened and agwyns father came in followed by a tag of servants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " fantastic!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " theyre prepared for the rite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned you have surpassed yourself tailoring such clothes with such short notice.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " n-no the chieftainess also helped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the larger man chuckled as he strode to the bed and picked up a confused agwyn dont undermine yourself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i know what my wife is capable of more than anyone else.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the attire for todays ritual is best left to the mother who can actually weave rather than my clumsy queen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hi daddee!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn spoke her eyes turning into crescents at bromwyns silly grin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was still clutching the cushion to her chest as she greeted good evewing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " good evening to you too my valiant princess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " today is a big day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are you excited?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn booped her nose with his giant index.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was listening attentively in on their exchange.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they made eye contact and she gave the boy an understanding nod.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what happening daddee?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she asked trying to grip hold of bromwyns offending finger.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " aha i forget you are yet babes sometimes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how clumsy of me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn slapped his forehead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn wondered if a slap so strong could leave marks in metal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your mothers asked us all to keep this a secret since they wanted it to be a big surprise.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am taking you both out of this courtyard today for your inaugural rite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its time for the entire clan to see how heroic my two little warriors are.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eh weally?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyns heartbeat sped up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she almost threw away the cushion in delight about to ask for details.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain beat her to the punch really?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we can finally leave this stifling room big guy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he left his protesting mother behind and grabbed onto bromwyns viking kilt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her father just grinned at that excited too are you?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " where ever did you learn to speak such complicated words as stifling?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and yes he ruffled elrhains bushy hair much to eluneds dismay.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " father has ordered a glorious feast of the final hunt on spring to celebrate the coming of summer and three strong cycles lived for the dearest prince and princess of our great clan!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn felt like time had stopped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the pillow almost slipped out of her hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still she clutched onto it even tighter by sheer impulse as if it was the only thing that could keep her exploding thoughts grounded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she felt parched and drowned at the same time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her breathing grew turbulent and her mind cluttered like a broken tractor.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if a jester was prancing a waltz wearing spiky circus shoes on her tiny brain as the spongy organ over-clocked to decipher the meaning of bromwyns words.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " en-gagemento?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " a woman the spitting image of agwyns just twenty years older popped up on the screen.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " a giant insignia of the collective was engraved in the marble wall behind her the same insignia was embroidered on her sleek black office suit.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " this better be important.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the air-conditional could not stop the outpour of cold sweat.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " her relaxed attitude was long gone and what was left was animalistic fury.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she slammed the desk hard with her fists and the teacup cluttered to the side because of the impact.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " mrs hildebrand?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain shouted into the line.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he asked a bad premonition rising in his chest.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the hovercar almost spun out of the maglev road as he kicked down the brakes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain searched around for the source of the voice and saw his tablet on the passenger seat.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " you know he said sliding open the glass panels.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a pleasant breeze drifted in bringing with it the fragrance of lavender.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the rain yesterday seemed to have washed away all the stains of the citys industrial wounds from the air.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " i shouldnt have hoped for more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so how about right now right here we make a promise?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the patch of purple outside the hospital building looked magnificent in his tired sight.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont want to risk our friendship for some feel-good chemical spikes in our brains.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " ive been waiting half my life for gods sake!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " no!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " enough waiting!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " so many years of hoping just hoping you would make a move that you would respond to my advances and did that do anything?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you just fooled around with some korean girl once then broke up over bloody ramen!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that has nothing to do with this!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain whimpered out his protest not finding the strength to even shout.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " why didnt you ever look at me!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he speculated all the possibilities all the ways it could go wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but in the end he came up blank.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " a pair of incredibly soft moist and mischievous lips forced themselves onto his own like a kiss-starved vampire.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " beige teal and grey.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " thirty minutes later agwyn and elrhain left their courtyard with the adults for the first time in their second lives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the three long cycles of mind-numbing captivity were at last over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in a clearing some minutes of walking away a few beasts of burden were grazing around eating grass with what looked to be baggage full of meat wild fruits and herbs tied to them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn being the hyper-excited chipmunk she was excitedly ran towards the herd as though they owed her hugs and cuddles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and one of the more enormous beasts snapped up with a jolt.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " suddenly his eyes met agwyns and his face froze like someone hit the pause button.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he awkwardly tried to smile at her but his facial muscles cramped.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " mother these are not pengytes?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain indeed found them adorable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but at a much higher and scientific level than eluned could ever fathom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he still beamed her an adorably scientist-y smile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh no pengytes are great predatory gheistrums born for carnage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his mother crossed her arms and placed a finger on her chin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these kaloxen are merely tamed ahnmigheists only good for ploughing the berry-farms and carrying items of baggage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i suppose their excreta is also useful for farmhand servants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " other than being slightly mean-tempered they do no harm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned led her son by the hand towards the back of the herd as she marked out various tidbits on the surrounding beasts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that over there she pointed her index finger at a prone red shape in the distance is a red pengyte.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a gheistrum with oceanic might.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " our clan chief's personal mount and companion beast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i heard from your father many tales and even legends of its feats.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he saw it tearing hordes of gheistrum more powerful than kaloxen in fewer than a hundred breaths many times throughout the cycles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " um mother are anmigheists weaker than gheistrums?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked meticulously examining the giant red menace.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was overwhelming.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it had a form comparable to a wolf's.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the muscles all over were destructively explosive even on the four limbs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its body wasn't hulking with muscles though.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the fat gave it a stocky build like the polar bears back on earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the pengyte however was bigger on all accounts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was at least three meters high at the shoulders even when it was lazing on the ground.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its length from snout to tail measured around ten or twelve.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it had obsidian claws the size of swords and they glinted with similar sharpness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at first he thought the whole beast was covered in scales because of how it reflected the sunlight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but closer now he saw it was all fur.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " metallic and flowy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the eyes were ruby red in a black sclera.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " two sharp coppery fangs jutted down from its upper jaw akin to musk deers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the beast let out a massive yawn as bromwyn once again had to pick up agwyn as she bolted towards it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " aww my son is so wise thinking such tough questions eluned lauded with a smile in her eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it's ahn-mi-gheist and they can be just as powerful.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since they too were once gheistrums tens of generations ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " gheistrums are simply the direct lineage of the manna-riogh's creations which makes them especially dangerous.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " manna riogh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked pondering over what he had just learned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but his mother shushed him as they approached the giant beast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this close and elrhain saw he could barely reach its folded legs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but something was wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rather than a polar bear in demeanour this looked more like a aha!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you are already here lady siaglas.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " come now gwyn go play with little rhain while the watches ready the herd.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i promise i will let you ride alleigh soon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so don't climb him on your own under any circumstances.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as gallant as he is he is a sensitive soul too shy with strangers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn reminded her as he let agwyn down from his shoulder into eluned's arms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn kept glancing at the silky fur in yearning.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the large man then called out to some of the watches who were minding the preparations as he went back towards the kaloxen herd.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the watches hearing his orders guided the beasts into a rough shape of a convoy going through the baggage tied to them one last time by the looks of it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn now being carried by eluned with her chin resting on his mother's shoulder peered down to meet elrhain's gaze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they both didn't know what to say to each other.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain finally could not stand the awkward silence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he gathered up his inner man and shouted um hi?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " h-hello!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " arf!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh my!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when the giant pengyte beside them barked out a silly woof completely misreading the atmosphere.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned backed away a few steps while keeping her composer steady.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the brave woman shielded the child in her arms away from the stinky breath while her glare towards the pengyte turned even more rotten.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain and agwyn on the other hand snapped towards alleigh like zombies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the pengyte who had just done what on earth would be called an oopsie seemed to cower under their intense gazes burying his red muzzle under his paws.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they both turned their eyes back towards each other in bewilderment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after a few more awkward seconds of silence the two broke into giggling laughter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned didn't know what was going on with the hysteric babies but joined in nonetheless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the merry mood seemed to give the pengyte the courage he needed as well.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alleigh warily looked towards them repeatedly then judging it safe flicked its tongue out followed by another arf.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain and agwyn laughed even louder and all the anxiety of the past hour simply evaporated.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 11 - what came first?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " were you avoiding me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was currently sitting on top of alleighs fluffy back with agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned sat behind them so that the children didnt fall and injure themselves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn the pengytes master scouted the forest trail ahead with his team of hunters for any rogue dangers on the way.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all manners of howls and screeches sounded from the deep jungle around them as the adults carried back pile after pile of animal carcasses or ahnmigheists as they called them here.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it took only minutes to bleed butcher and bind the meat and bones into leafy bags.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " which they then secured to the kaloxen while expert shovellers simply buried the waste parts in the ground.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " strangely enough they were throwing away a large portion of the meat too alongside the waste which confused elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but what interested him more were the varied uses of magic spells from the entire ahnmigheist processing steps.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i need to record all the diverse uses of magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain added to his to-do list.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with the cacophony of nature and eluneds melodic humming as a backdrop the two children whispered to each other in their faux-telepathy about this and that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had practised over the years to make their whole secret conversation gig subtler.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now they could talk nonsense outwards in uorian while the actual communication superimposition itself in earth common.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was just so bloody embarrassing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn frantically waved her hands at elrhains question.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hells below we were saying such c-cheesy lines.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " imagine if our parents could actually understand us.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain flinched his face too blushing wildly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he definitely shared her sentiment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no matter how passionate and pink the moment was suddenly shouting high school level love comedy quotes was always a big no-no.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " middle school he corrected himself squirming in mental agony.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont bring it up ever i beg you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i feel like dying every time i remember that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain pleaded deciding to change the topic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " b-by the way did you see the suns?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " deal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn nodded furiously playing along with elrhains attempt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and suns?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " theres only one though.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nope.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if you look closer you will see another two concentrated specks of light on the bottom-right edge of its corona.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and a big one on the upper-left.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they are so close together that they look like one big if unevenly spherical sun to the untrained eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i think uorys diosca is like the 30-ari-a quadruple star system.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " huh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how did you see all that without shades or a telescope?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and i heard mommy call it the respected sohwl and how it rains down fire whenever the dhionne and the faediaga contempt the disc.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn muttered glancing up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she wanted to get a better look at the four suns just to be sure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but only a portion of the sky peaked out through the thick forest canopy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so the sohwl which was now westward from its midday position couldnt be seen clearly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " come to think of it the only time we could see the suns was during noontime when we were playing in the courtyard garden.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yeah the clouds always covered it otherwise elrhain shrugged.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet no strange swirl of clouds to be seen now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just another enigma of magic we need to figure out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they went on chattering about odd things they noticed along the way.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their convoy of beasts moved through the lush mountain trail passing one peak after another.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their short journey also took them by myriads of mystical lakes caves full of growling beasts and actual floating islands making the two positively wow out loud till their jaws went sore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " right now they were on the fringe of a mountain full of tall bamboo-like trees going downwards.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they could see a misty valley in the distance with the splashing sound of waterfalls getting louder by the minute.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " many other mountains surrounded the same valley creating a foggy dreamlike scenery like the adobe of hermits in tales of eastern mythology.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the blushing awkwardness from before was nowhere to be seen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or it was still there and they both tactfully ignored it much to elrhains relief.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the journey itself had been quite pleasant which helped him no small amount in calming down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the trail under alleighs feet was well paved with rubble and stone with very few bumps.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " occasionally they would come by groups of large huts made of mud and stone with straw and branch roofing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dhionne people each with one or two strange physical features were scurrying about their everyday tasks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each time a team of natives would join the convoy decked out in ceremonial clothing such as gaudy gheist-pelt robes or kilts fang and bone ornaments and jewellery made of beautiful rocks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their heads donned feather headdresses and bone crowns with painted totems on their faces and bodies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " most of them had skin colour the shades of honey brown or olive green generally of the milder tones.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some had tails with others sprouting antlers and horns.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain even spotted one extremely old dhionne man who had clawed fingers on all of his scaled reptilian limbs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he reverently came to greet bromwyn with a band of dhionne following behind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after a conversation with exaggerated body language they too joined the convoy bringing in their own set of beasts of burden.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dhionne villages?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont you think its too tiny to be a village?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there are only 30 or so people in so few houses most of which are adjoint.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe a family home?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " those dhionne all have identical scales as that grandpa.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn observed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain supposed it was possible.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at first he thought their courtyard was utterly remote.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " were they banished or clan outcasts?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that didnt sound plausible either with how reverential the servants were towards their familyespecially cyra bromwyn and thundham.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now he concluded that the distance between one familys house to anothers was simply absurdly far.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie how do you reckon they keep security?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i hear a lot of monsters em gheist roars in this area.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn thought for a while then pointed at the bone and stone weapons being carried by the dhionne people.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some even had metal swords of a bronze-ish glimmer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they knew metal was rare in this world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was exclusively employed for weapons shields and armours.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " never for tools.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " see how even the children are strutting around with spikes?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they probably welcome animal trespassers since it means free dinner.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for christs sake look at that one with the spear!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she looks even younger than me!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn said waving at a particularly curious little girl who was staring at alleigh with drool dripping from her mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the girl jolted awake like a bunny as if feeling agwyns immoral gaze and ran away to hide behind the claw handed grandpa.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hng so cute.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now that i think about it those gheists your father and his men caught dont look particularly monster-ish either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so each family handles their own safety in this relatively safer area?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i assume so yes!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " besides i think alleigh might also have a part in it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn gently leaned forward and patted the patch of discoloured fur on the pengytes forehead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the magical huskyand elrhain would fight with anyone who said otherwisejerked his neck around and stuck his tongue out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few good-natured giggles from agwyn made him woof in glee.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they all have several tamed gheiststrums or or stronger ahnmigheists in each family.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you see how packed that eight-legged iguana is?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and look at that rhino!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh god it has beautiful grass patches growing on its hide and blossoms on the horns.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn started at the latter in wonder how magical.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you think its a fairy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ew no way.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain peered away from the monstrosity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " any chance they pee around the houses to mark their territory to keep interlopers out?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like wild tigers back on earth?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn gagged at the image and thwacked elrhains shoulders.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stop being weird!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " those are tamed beasts pets!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they should have designated spots for excreta!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i disagree a litter box sounds like a concept too advanced for these tribal folks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he observed all the gheists in convoy including alleigh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the mounts dont have saddles or harnesses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " on that note i have seen no fabric clothing or threads as of yet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then pointed at one of the kaloxen no wheelbarrows wagons or carts either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they paved this road so well with stone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why simply tie the bundle to a beast and not some sort of wheeled carrier?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this all looks inefficient.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " err let me consider.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn closed her eyes to concentrate rubbing the sides of her skull with her fingers they have stone-paved roads but it could be for the mounts right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some of these beasts dont look like they were built for trekking the unstable mountain hills.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however our earthling ancestors invented wheels in i dont know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it should be before paved roads right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was in 5500 bce on earth 1500 years before the first paved road was made in mesopotamia.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and wheels were first used in pottery i think.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " speaking of sticky mud elrhain rubbed his nose our courtyard was built with stone timber and some sort of grey adhesive lime right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh cement then?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when was that invented?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " probably not the modern kind which was invented around the 1800s.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but yes a cementitious composite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like the roman limestone and volcanic ash version used in the early 300 bce.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there are some serious technological discrepancies with this world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or maybe they are in use just not here in the valleys and mountains?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont you think youre overthinking this?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain laughed and brushed agwyns squishy cheek.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " physical contact had turned into a casual habit for them with thirty earth years of constant crib-company.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i suppose so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but those are just some of the weirdness i noticed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " such as?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn blinked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had tossed a chunk of dried meat at alleigh just now and the pengyte was contentedly chewing on the meal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ive never seen any papyrus vellum let alone paper being used in the clan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only very roughly processed parchment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all the language books i found were actually animal-skin scrolls.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet they have intricate bone-made fountain pens with removable cartilage nibs and ink cartridges that use minerals from rocks ash and actual blood for ink!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain exclaimed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain then explained why those kinds of pens should not even exist in this time period.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " on earth the first ink pen was invented in the 1820s.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before that were the dip pens quill pens and even earlier were reed pens.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in fact reed pens were developed around the same time as the papyrus.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though at first they used it as a cuneiform stylus for clay writing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " later they invented ink from grinding minerals and noticed reed pens could be used to write on papyrus much more logistically viable than large clay slabs which had to be dried afterwards.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were even more precise than human fingers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn slowly bobbed her head come to think of it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " none of the dwellings here uses fired bricks either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not even our fancy courtyard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet they can smelt metal swords.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i asked that to grandfather when i first noticed all of this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he didnt even know what a brick was.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain excitedly nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he rather enjoyed discussions like these.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so ive been using the lucid dreams to jog my memory.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to get hold of the specifics and nitty-gritty details if by chance i had ever read a book article or watched a video on any of these topics.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " luckily i watched a few good documentaries on the history of pen and paper.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is that why you were so tired lately even though you sleep more than me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded averting his eyes from her narrowing gaze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ellie didnt you say youll do it in moderation?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " youll turn into one of those virtual reality junkies at this rate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn grabbed his head and turned it her way.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " look at me!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i was!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain defended himself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " can i get back on topic please?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i was just getting to the good part.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we are not finished you know?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but sure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn snorted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " excellent!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain cheered intentionally ignoring her stink eyes before going back to his lecture we can either attribute all this to magic and sorcery.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " perhaps the denizens of this world simply chose another path of development.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " perhaps they spent all their intelligence pursuing magical or martial strength and neglected all other sciences.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the discrepancy is still too glaring.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there must be something we are missing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you get me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " duh agwyn chided we are barely a meter tall and this is our first trip outside.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you need to get some first-hand knowledge to come to a real conclusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yeah haha.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain scratched his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " youre right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i have a suspicion that my guess is not too far from the truth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no matter the civilisation there is always a specific flow in inventions from simple to complex like papyrus necessitating reed pens as an ink-scribe tool.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes this flow gets broken a lot as the application of an invention is limited only by our imagination.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but never to this large of a margin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just consider the case with the bone fountain pens i mentioned earlier.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lets look at it from a historical perspective.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " experts have hypothesised that while some ancient human tribes in the palaeolithic age used dried animal skin for painting murals similar to cave art it was exceedingly rare.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ancient parchment scrolls like our clans were used for writing for the first time in the same period as papyrus.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain stopped to catch his breath and organise his thoughts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn attentively listened with her cheeks resting on her palms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but when papyrus got widespread with exports from egypt parchment virtually vanished because of its complicated manufacturing process.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was only popularised again thousands of years later when papyrus production dwindled as the reeds used to make them were over-harvested.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after that came vellum then books.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the chinese invented paper independently during the 2nd century bce.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet it only replaced vellum entirely throughout the known world during the 11th century ce.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was 500 years after the paper was first exported out of china in the 600s.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you said the fountain pens even had internal ink reservoirs?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn picked up the key point.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even at the earliest estimated period when vellum was first widely used and not the badly processed animal-skin parchments like the clans they were using quills at best.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not even a dip pen is possible which was only used after pigment-based ink was invented like india ink.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " fountain pens came even later and they could never use pigment-based ink like the clans gheist blood properly since it would clog the pen in no time only water and dye-based.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet here elrhain looked towards agwyn for her opinion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " indeed that is a large skip in generations she agreed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whats weirder is how they make the pens and why they dont clog or corrode.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or even though they dont process the parchments to accept ink better they still work well.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain shook his head in defeat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mommy told me there are storytellers in the clan township in the valley and a shaman she called the keeper of the archives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe you can get more clues there?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well its just a peeve of mine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded before smiling mischievously at agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if nothing now we can become the mysterious and knowledgeable wisemen of this era who can bring out witch-craft far stranger than magic from their tiny little noggins.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " such as chemical fertiliser!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or ice cream!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or muskets and gunpowder!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe even modern eco-friendly biological weaponry!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn beamed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lets limit ourselves to ice cream for now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain shivered trying to push the evil thoughts away from agwyns head by repeatedly whacking it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn awkwardly laughed after shoving away his hand i was just kidding.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a joke hey!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why are you looking at my hands?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i promise i didnt have my fingers crossed!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the convoy members then carried the baggage the rest of the way themselves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " about a kilometre north of their position was a quaint dhionne village or township as eluned called it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it encompassed the valleys mountain slopes around the river mouth with stone structures popping out of the green forest canopy like some elven settlement.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " houses huts spires and more mostly made of white marble stone wood and clay brimming with an archaic charm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " where the river ended a series of waterfalls fell down tens of meters hitting one inclined ridge after another.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " a small mountain on its own the temple-like-edifice looked far more intricate in design than everything else in the surrounding.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet it was scarred with the ruination of both time and war.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the smaller huts and buildings that dotted ridges from the river mouth down to the lake waters felt like part of a grand archaeological ruin because of that one looming form.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was evident to elrhain that all the dhionne architecture the two had seen until now were designed after it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even their own courtyard which was a five-hour pengyte-ride away had elements resembling this temple.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is that maglev?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked expecting no reply but wishing for an answer.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " until now elrhain was happy just speculating on the nature of this world and its magic from inside that enclosed room no matter how boring it might have sometimes felt.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " but mother this is a biblical moment for us!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain protested.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was an experience entirely new for him even considering all the virtual tech back on earth.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " pretty pwease?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he beamed when agwyn came to his help.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " his ears perked up as he noticed the three approaching his tail wagging like a motorboat rudder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn waved at them when they got into earshot.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he hid an aggravated expression right before switching to his usual jolly one which both elrhain and agwyn noted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how was the sight my valiant little warriors?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i remembered the first time i laid my eyes on the loch sagathan temple.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " it only has true meaning in that very first moment and everything else is just an extra.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " ahem!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a light but audible cough interrupted his back and forth with bromwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked in the direction of the sound and saw it was the antlered dhionne bromwyn had been talking to until they came.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old man had a lightly curled palm in front of his mouth as he observed them with the same weird eyes as a kaloxens.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora please accept my deepest apologies for my insolence bromwyn said but with a jovial laugh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the twitch in that voice was not hidden from the boy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked up at the larger man in confusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " did he always talk like this?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then saw elder sonora look towards him from the corner of his eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was something in that expression that he didnt quite like.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain subconsciously shifted towards his mother and grabbed her hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no apologies needed my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora shifted his gaze from elrhain to eluned and finally to agwyn who was resting in her arms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked shocked for a split second then a glint appeared deep in his eyes that made elrhains skin crawl.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but an eye-blink later elder sonora was back to normal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he questioned with a raised eyebrow and a scowl on his face could they perhaps be the?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain plugged his ears at the booming laughter that followed certainly indeed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i will leave the formal introduction of my valiant daughter and son-in-law at the ceremony on this holy night.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they are still quite young and need proper rest before the hectic rituals begin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then extended an arm towards eluned with an open palm this beautiful young woman here would be lady eluned earthloch siaglas the wife of reanakt siaglas and our proud in-laws.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she and her siaglas homestead were ones who have been caring for our daughter in me and my wifes absence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned hastily bowed in the noble custom after putting agwyn down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she looked unfamiliar with the process and nervous at being scrutinized by so many elderly figures most of whom were noble homestead owners themselves if not even having manors and minor dominions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were also the free tribesmen in the service of the earthloch siorrakty with their sigils removed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " great warriors of vast magical might with their freedom earned by contributions to the clan by themselves or by the grace of their ancestors.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " either way they could not be compared with the servants who made up the vast majority of the population.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " many of them were even in charge of managing said earthloch servants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few cycles ago eluned could only look at their free and unbound lifestyle from afar not even knowing how to feel jealous.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet now she was their equal in name and superior in standing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that i can see.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora spoke with a leisurely tone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his eyes seem to scrutinize eluneds attire her ornaments and most importantly her worth as a noble.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain did not like that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you were a herb tendering servant working at clan elder landohrs medicinal garden if the words are to be believed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " y-yes elder sonora.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder landohr had taken great care of me during the time for which i am eternally grateful.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned raised her head in answer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a na\u00efve smile on her face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that she has.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " very well then caretaker eluned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will leave our dialogue at that then.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " remember to take good care of all the princesss needs as you always have for our noble-blood clan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora finally showed a slight change in expression from his seemingly eternal frown.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a raised corner of his lips followed by a nasal laugh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain didnt like that either and he could sense agwyn fuming too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora not noticing the discontent he sowed turned towards bromwyn and bowed elegantly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his movements natural none of the clunkiness like eluned had shown.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it appears that this is not a good time for our discussion my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will have to trouble you after the week is over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after a polite hand wave from bromwyn in return he left in the direction of the township with his cohort.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but not before giving elrhain eluned and agwyn one final glance over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his gaze lingered on agwyn for far longer than elrhain was comfortable with.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little boy scrunched up his face while staring at the leaving figures.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " many homestead headsmen had left with the group along with the freemen warriors with only the grandpa with clawed fingers and two other middle-aged figures staying behind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they shared a few polite words with bromwyn and eluned much to the chieftains delight and finally wished well for agwyn and elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my little one has been chattering non-stop to meet you two young master siaglas and princess of earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do humour her when the time comes a few cycles later only if you remember this old face by then of course.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hahaha.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with a toothy grin the claw-handed grandpa and the other two also left towards the township.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well i am glad that was over with.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shall we make haste toois something bothering you my fair daughter?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn was just about to call back alleighwho had been quite active this whole time trying to attract their attentionwhen he noticed a grumpy agwyn purple in the face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont wike them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she replied.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they mean.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont want to be here anymore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn gagged at that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he tried to coo her gently now now princess its not nice to say that about people you have just met.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im sure youll change your mind when we get to the elders rest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you are taking their side!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " daddee doesnt wuv me anymore!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn harrumphed in the opposite direction while puffing her cheeks and crossing her arms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn tried to talk to her with a panicked expression immediately after.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still she just kept facing away and finally buried her face in eluneds bosom completely ignoring the flustered giant.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned just kept looking at the two awkwardly not knowing what to do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain seeing it going nowhere tugged at bromwyns kilt will grandpa thundham be mad at us if we are late big guy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn looked down at him then let out an exhausted sigh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he said a few more pampering words to agwyn to no avail then helped the three get up on the magical husky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he would walk back with the rest of his huntsmen and watches.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as the clan chieftain he was far busier than even the two children who were tonights events main focus.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain scrutinized agwyns tiny face now on sitting top of alleigh again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned was trying to soothe the moody little girl but that made her pout harder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie you look like you ate a whole lemon raw.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain laughed poking her chubby cheeks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when he saw her not responding he just kept on poking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just keep poking!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just keep poking!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stop that!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn finally broke her demeanour with a giggle as she swatted away the offending finger.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few seconds of playful scuffle later she asked arent you mad at those stuck-up pricks?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they made fun of eluned like they had boiled eggs up their butt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hey its not their fault they are uncultured.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ellie!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay fine i am mad.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but whats the use of pouting.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " will they learn better manners if we do?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain shrugged.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and stop being so hard on the big guy he looked like an abandoned kitten.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it feels so wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn gritted her teeth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i just want to punch their faces in ah!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then remember their faces and wait for a chance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there is an old saying kindness tenfold and enmity hundredfold.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we cant do anything now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain gave her a tight hug from behind and whispered tenderly into her cute pointy ears but when we make magical tuxedos soft silk shawls and shiny leather cardigans for mother while they still walk around in those drab beast hide pelts well see who gets the last civilized laugh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn paused and turned towards him in wonder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the smile she showed him was so radiant it blinded the suns.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 13 - dungeon spelunking welcome to lochuir my loves!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned exclaimed with an oriole laugh as she led the two kids into the mystical township.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " arent we going to the elders rest like the big guy said?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked absent-mindedly his slit-blue eyes darting in every direction like magnets.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn also kept tugging his sleeves to point out each new absurdity she saw while gasping ooohs and aaahs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mother cant take you there because of the rite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " someone will come and escort you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned said and elrhain could pick up some concern in her voice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he ignored it because there were more urgent things to ponder about.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like how were these town folks fastening a lump of dirt gravel and vines into open-walled pavilions with a few gestures of their hands?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or why were those groups of dhionne with gills and blue skin worshipping those horrendous sculptures made of fishbones lining up along the wharf?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to mention what were these tiny and adorable little critters that flocked around the area where the fish were being processed?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they fought each other to eat the black gunk like wastes left to the side ignoring the scales and discarded meat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after which they swelled up like cute fluffy balloons and popped!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " scattering chunks of solid shiny materials all over the place.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain felt he had a heart attack and agwyn started crying before they noticed something even more bizarre.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the original adorable critter was left behind in its original spot confused and mewling looking left and right as if to take in the situation then went back to repeat the process pushing through its brethren for more black gunk.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn squealed and ran off like a puppy to hug one of them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but a band of muscular fishers with their tops exposedservants by their sigils blocked her path with grim determination and refused to budge.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn tried to tackle through while screeching war cries but eluned picked her up in a panic before hastily leaving that area.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could sense the suspicious glares those men sent even as they walked away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it physically stung.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and so their exciting tour continued with shrieks yells and laughter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was the hustle and bustle here in lochuir but nothing like the cities on earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it felt exhilarating it felt invigorating.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " things were just about to get more fun for the two when another group of people blocked their path.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time elrhain recognized them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were a few servants headed by elder croneira the nice if grumpy old lady that visited them often to check up on their health.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lady siaglas good that you could make it on time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the voice was hoarse and there were dark bags under her eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned shifted in her place with a stiff smile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont make this difficult young lady.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder croneira sighed then spoke like some mafioso hand them over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " um.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned was about to argue but the elder held one of her palms up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " look i know you are worried.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i thought we went over this a few days ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the father leads the boy and the mother leads the girl.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you weave the blood-tethered robes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the elder said with no small amount of frustration and please for the love of our great lakes and the spirits i havent slept in seven days!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i would really rather have this up and over with.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the young mother agonized for a few more breaths and elrhain felt her literally pry her hand away from his own.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your father and the chieftainess will be there.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned said kneeling to their eye level and hugging them tightly listen to the elder on the way down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and little gwyn dont rush off promise?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " pwomise!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl replied while elrhain wondered if they were actually being taken to some dangerous place where agwyns shenanigans could brew actual harm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " --- they were not at least in his opinion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet he could understand why his mother was so worried.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because for other typical toddlers their age this underground world was most definitely dangerous.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the humidity the deepwater pools sharp rocks and slippery algae the hundreds of meter drops and so many interesting glowing things a hyper curious baby could run after to their doom if left unsupervised for even a second.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " right now elrhain and agwyn were standing before two cryptic doors deep under the loch sagathan temples.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it took an hour and a half of careful dungeon spelunking with the adults carrying them protectively to reach here.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder croneira brought the two wide-eyed kids deep down the winding stairs carved into the walls passed by soaking hallways covered in bio-luminescent moss and algae which were also engraved with pictures telling tales of yore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they walked on bridges with streams of all shapes below the rumbling echo of water beating their ears like a ritual drum and the damp air around them felt like salty sea wind on their skin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they trod through caverns with mazes of aqueducts crisscrossing amid the air carrying untold volumes of shining blue water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the water would often splash down and before elrhain could take a closer look the glow would vanish as if it wasnt magical.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " littered around them were debris and pillars jutting out of the ground in odd angles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were dressed in algae and moss both of which illuminated the artworks inscribed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn had an even harder time staying put than elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for example when they crossed a pristine temple complex submerged under crystal clear water she had to bite her own hand to hold in the urge to dive in and explore for lost atlantis treasures.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and at the end of their journey behind the many waterfalls tumbling down from the cracks and broken aqueducts above they stepped into one such temple.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this one wasnt submerged but that was only true for the part elrhain could see.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he turned towards agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl was standing a few paces to the right fidgeting about in either nervousness or impatience.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her eyes were glued to a small jagged crystal on the door right in front of her hesitating if she should touch it or not.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to elrhain the murky blue sheen made her small elven features look even more like a dream.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet when he saw her eyes that dream of fantasy broke.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was no anxiety there just an insatiable thirst for adventure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked behind him to a sleepy elder croneira and one other servant standing between them and the deep plunge below.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the passageway floor ended with a row of pillars in that direction but there were no walls.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they could see the dimly illuminated cavern hundreds of meters away from where they stood.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if they were on top of a mountain peak.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain had peaked down a few minutes earlier out of curiosity and immediately scuttled back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder croneira had to pry agwyns grip from the ledge of the corridor when she did the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " under this open-air corridor was a colossal statue of a dhionne hoisting up various weapons and items in its many hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the temple complex they had entered in the other cavern opened up inside a flower carved out of stone in this one with corridors making up its stems and petals.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this flower was set upon one of the statues hands.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the sorrow of the statue didnt give rise to empathy within him just fear and awe.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its like the water temple from that popular video game with the time-travelling ocarina.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain thought with nostalgia as he now ran his hands over the etchings on the door.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the material felt cold like metal yet grainy like wood.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i wonder what the locking mechanism is?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was a paragraph written in an unknown tongue carved on it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the inscriptions slid under his fingers seamlessly as if the creators of this place had shaped the door around it and not the other way around.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked up and found the writings snake towards the ceiling in neat yet twisting rows.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain couldnt understand what they conveyed but was sure it wasnt uorian.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these words even moved which none of the scripts on the scrolls he had seen had done.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with a jolt and a shake they hid into the gaps of the walls as his eyes followed them before his tiny brain could even comprehend what happened.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " creak ah wait it was the door which moved.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain stepped back as the giant panel started sliding left with the noise of rusty gears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few seconds later the door was gone with a clink and a clank.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " another tunnel lay behind the now open entrance a gust of warm wind rushed out as if to greet them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it flew past the two standing in the corridor into the cavern outside to open walls raising echoes of the gale in the vast space of the crying statue.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain peered at this tunnels walls.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they looked flat smooth even.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they still had cracks here and there but with a utilitarian industrial flavour as a whole.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he turned to agwyn in askance and she shot back the same look.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was a clump of moss she found somewhere in her hands and she kept squeezing it like a plushie.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain felt a pat on his shoulder and saw it was elder croneira.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old woman looked eerie in this dim lighting but her tone was gentler than before.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " follow servant thomos inside.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but let him know immediately if you feel unwell.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " can you do that boy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded swallowing in uncertainty as his eyes crossed with agwyns once again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " good good.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont worry about the heiress though it warms my heart you do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder croneira said with a good-natured smile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet her crooked teeth and wrinkly skin sent goosebumps through his body.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old woman muttered under her breath i will escort the princess myself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you two will always be within 10 meters of each other even with this wall in the middle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it will be fine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what will be fine?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why would i feel unwell?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain remembered all those stories about miners and cave explorers dropping like flies because of the stagnant air and carbon monoxide deep within the earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he wanted to question her but the old lady shushed him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder croneira thought intently for a few more moments.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then gently but suddenly she held agwyn by the hand while stepping inside.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn didnt want to go.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she cried out and stretched her hands towards elrhain with a pleading look.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the sudden tug had taken her by surprise and she was already inside the right tunnel.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain tried to rush in but thomos stopped him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " young master dont be hasty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the servant said trying to calm elrhain down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thomos then gestured towards the tunnel and stuck his hand in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains eyes widened in shock as ripples appeared in space.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " an invisible barrier stopped thomoss hand from going in any further.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder croneira stood on the other side of the ripples sighing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her expression looked both annoyed and humourous as if she was trying hard to hold in a smirk and bring out a scowl aye you two are making us look like villains.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they both blushed and the elder laughed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " children there is no need to be so afraid.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this is simply another part of the ritual for the heir and heiresss engagement and inaugural ceremony.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no man can enter the wifes door and no lady can enter the other.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she stopped for a bit to look over their faces and elrhain felt his cheeks heat up even further.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that smile on elder croneiras face was mortifying.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two clan shamans inside will explain to you what to do and i cannot tell you more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since this is not even my jurisdiction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " greats spirits what i do for the clan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with a few more promises persuasions and one last hug from agwyn who had come out of the tunnel later they were finally willing to go in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the fear rising from deep within elrhains chest didnt abate as he watched the last visage of elder croneira and agwyns silhouette vanish into the darkness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 14 - two parts of the same stone\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " itll be alright.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain pushed down the nauseous fear in his chest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its not like we wont see each other again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then scoffed slapping his cheeks hard with both palms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the noise rang in the empty cavern like a bronze gong and servant thomos almost jumped out of his shoes in fright.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dammit elrhain stop acting like a romeo.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this is ridiculous.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain sat down on the damp floor and took a few more minutes to calm down and think about the issue.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then smiled as the exact haunting words he said to agwyn so long ago bubbled up in his chest just now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i almost threw up after agwyn went inside didnt i?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when she left my sights completely.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he reflected on those split seconds of his guts churning like venom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could smell the stink of vomit in his throat and the tight pain in his chest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was suffocating he could not breathe.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was weird.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nausea and pain rapidly retreated after that as fast as they had come.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but they never died out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even now he could feel something missing as if something both physical and spiritual had been ripped from his being.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this violent reaction on both his mind and body was bewildering to say the least.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had long outgrown high-school lover drama where he would feel physical pain not seeing his girlfriend for five minutes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet here he was feeling precisely that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sure we have seldom ever left each others sight the last three cycles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but this is just retarded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there has got to be more to this ill condition.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait could this be what elder croneira was talking about?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wiping the saliva from the corners of his mouth he glanced up at thomos with critical eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the servant stared back at him with an anxious expression then looked away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man was half crouched as if to help him up but his hands had stopped awkwardly in the air.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain beamed at him a smile and thomoss face froze in shock.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mister thomos im ready.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lets go in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain said noticing the shock morph into surprise across the mans visage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thomos was scrawny and had gills on his neck.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his skin was somewhat blue and elrhain noticed a thin webbing between his fingers when he let the nervous man hold his hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but thomos never held it too tight as if afraid elrhain would get hurt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain didnt appreciate that but he would ponder upon this issue of masters and servants later.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the corridor like the rest of this underground world had an ambient blue and green glow.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the walls had this metallic sheen with creaks of luminous water running along cracks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could not see any murals on the surfaces which he now found out of place in this mural laden underground world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the repeated thudding of two footsteps one quiet and the other timid accompanied them as they made their way through.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the boy fell into a trance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the silent steps helped him still his restless heart but he did not seem to realize the passing of time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before he knew it the passageway opened up into another cavernous room.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the light inside was bright as the suns when the boy crossed the threshold and elrhain felt his vision go blind in white.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he closed his eyes and covered them with his palms for a few breaths of time only letting a small groan escape his lips as the sudden deprivation of senses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when he opened them again he saw a roof full of spheres that shone like sunlight reaching from the ground below to the very ceilings above and thomos nowhere to be seen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he craned his neck back down again and found the servant.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " along with two other men.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald stood there by the far wall wearing an elaborate ceremonial attire that fit him like a k-pop idol.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he talked respectfully to a hunched figure in blue robes holding a white staff before turning towards the crouching boy at the entrance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his father called him come.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain obliged.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he knew some people might take dofnalds short utterances as signs of disinterest or mock.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but to him that was just dofnald being dofnald.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone had their ticks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn was boisterous eluned was timid and cyra was an air-headed menace.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " speaking of which i hope agwyns met her mother by now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " knowing her shes probably sniffing around the cracks in the corridor.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he chuckled at the image.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait young master.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thomos suddenly spoke tension coloured his meek voice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the servant pointed towards the wall on the right saying please walk along this wall um as per elder croneiras words.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so you dont stray too far from the princess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded stepping forward with his hand lightly brushing the bumpy partition that divided him from her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am willing to bet all my spice patents that distance has something to do with our malady.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as he neared the two older dhionne he noticed that the shamans robes were fashioned out of fish scales and the staff was made of translucent bone-like cartilage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it even had the skull of some small creature on the top the jaws clanking up and down as the old man tapped the staff on the stone floor.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shaman looked only a little less wizened than elder croneira but way more than thundham.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was also antlered just like elder sonora.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but much to elrhains relief the shamans smile gave off a pleasant feeling not a disdainful sneer like the other antlered man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his eyes were big and blue even the sclera was light indigo.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they looked perfectly in place on his aged face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain hopped on the stone stage where his father and the shaman stood and bowed cordially like his mother taught him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before he could straighten his back though he felt a pat on his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was the shaman.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old man then plucked a few strands of elrhains hair ouch!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " poked his body at the joints with the staff.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hey!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and finally tugged the robe he was wearing stretching it up for a closer sniff.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stop that you perverted coon!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains childlike shout echoed in the chamber.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the servant thomos stumbled on the ground and dofnald coughed a few times in embarrassment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when elrhain finally stopped huffing and puffing he saw the old shaman look down at him with a grin on his ugly face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " haha quite spirited aintcha?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain clenched his tiny fists and punched committing the first violent act of this life.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the shaman just hopped away with booming santa clause guffaws.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain on the other hand was about to trip over because his fists missed their target.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but before his face could hit the ground his father held him up by the armpits from behind and he settled down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " father can you let me down?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i have to beat up a paedophile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " pe-what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain sighed just let me down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald nodded and elrhain felt his feet touch the ground.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked up at his father and asked why didnt you stop that old man when he hit me with a stick?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald thought for a while before saying grand elder ordered the rite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " can you explain more clearly?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald scratched his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few seconds later he continued your hair as a reagent for the rite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the staff pushed rejuvenating manna in your bodys joints.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your clothes eluned made them with special treasures with elder croneiras teaching.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shaman checked quality.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that was the most elrhain heard his father say in one go.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rejuvenating?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain patted his body all over and noticed that the fatigue he had felt from the journeyeven though he walked little himself was gone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then he heard the detested shaman speak again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " excellent!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well the attire could have looked better but the azhrite is rubbed in well.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this will do perfectly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked towards dofnald pointing at the deranged old man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " father?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shaman maeog.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not his name.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but thank you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald looked at him and smiled you are welcome.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain had seen boy bands and male idols in his past life with his nieces and especially miramarja posting their pictures all over their social media bedrooms and secret bases.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet he had never seen such a handsome man ever.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain shook his head to get rid of that ridiculous thought and asked another question the rite is it magical?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for heiresss inaugural and this time betrothal too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " great honour.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it happens once every there was another pause as he thought it over every time there is a new heiress who also has a betrothed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yeah thank you captain obvious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you are welcome?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain felt something wet touch his cramping face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old shaman was finger painting some tattoos there while muttering incoherently before the little boy could scream expletives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain considered if it was even worth it to lash out and found the answer to be no.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so with dwindling fury in his chest he turned back towards dofnald and continued his questioning.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why am i getting betrothed to annie?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i heard father and mother were servants before we were born and she is the chieftains daughter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald paused angling his head towards the far wall.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a complicated look flashed past his eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain followed his gaze to find more murals there.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but these ones were more intricate complete and had a depth to them that the ruined ones outside didnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " huh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he suddenly noticed that even shaman maeog had slowed down the paint job as he peered at dofnald with a sharp glint.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could hear a deep inhale from someplace behind him too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was the servant thomos who had otherwise been entirely silent this whole time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " should i have not asked that in peoples presence?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he thought.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cant tell you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i pledged not to in public.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " grand elder will explain later.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally dofnald acknowledged with a sigh casting an apologetic look at maeog who just huffed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then glanced at elrhain with his five-star smile back on his face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chieftain grand shamanka and grand elders arrangement for you two.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " secrecy is necessary but i trust them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they are good folks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they treat us like family.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " give us freedom and let us choose a name.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked disappointed with the answer but didnt press further.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and a split second after that the speed of the finger painting which had slowed a tad picked up again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rhain dont worry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everything will be ok. trust us.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he knew that and he trusted them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but ugh that makes me even more curious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even though its about us they can at least trust me in return that my- elrhain looked at his tiny palms and chubby arms oh right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we still toddlers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there all finished.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " quite an outstanding job if i say so myself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you look just as our earthloch ancestor did when he married the lake mother.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shaman maeog said after removing his fingers from elrhains face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old man put his dry hand on elrhains chin to move the boys head left and right for a final one over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the lines wonderfully align with all the nodes on your head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " honestly i would say i was quite unsatisfied with the upper echelons choice of heir consort before today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but maeog pulled away looking extremely satisfied.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ive never seen two dhionnes souls match up so thoroughly in all the rites ive performed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and believe me ive performed many.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to mention this rite is especially complex since you will be betrothed with the magic of epoch crossing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains eyes widened ignoring the offhand insult and the grand speech of magic you can see annies too?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shes not here!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shaman maeog laughed aloud reaching into the sleeves of his robes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " from there he took out a parchment scroll.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course not young heir siaglas.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no man can peer into the chamber for the heiress.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then how?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked at the scroll intrigued.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the elder scrutinized him with a grin then said to dofnald eager little one you have got here reanakt siaglas.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald smiled proudly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but ive always appreciated the curious ones.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they tend to walk the true path of rites and mages rather than all the muscle flair of warriors like you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald shifted awkwardly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shaman maeog laughed again and looked back towards elrhain opening the scroll up with a swipe of his hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he didnt stop elrhain when the boy peered over the drawings on it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we the shamans of the rites were simply provided with an abstraction of both of your manna nodes channels and frames the previous cycle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he placed his fingers on the numerous rough diagrams and strange anatomical sketches of what could only be two young dhionne babies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats us!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were lines of many colours connecting their frames from one point to another on the scroll with abstract smudges and shapes scribbled all over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the grand shamanka ordered us to not only to establish the flawless patterns for the rite but that it would be for children of barely three cycles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " children uninitiated in the ways of manna no less!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shaman stroked his wiry beard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " madness i thought at first.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " trying to bond two babes like this is suicidal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the recoil of these he excitedly pointed out various points on the diagrams and elrhain let out some ahhs and oohs at the sight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this animated the old man even more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uneven nodes will kill you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but after we toiled months and seasons to complete them the results left us absolutely dumbfounded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shaman maeog threw his hands up with joy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the completed sigils of inheritance and union for you two had fallen perfectly into place!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like two halves of the same stone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yours on hers and hers on yours.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was as if all that unevenness were made even when we compared you two together and not separately.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shaman maeog took a deep breath and elrhain cursed this world for not having pocket notebooks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he really wanted to jot all of this down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet now we do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course only me the finest ritualist of earthlochs could have even conceived such magnificent and sophisticated patterns so quickly so exquisitely.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old man concluded his sermon with another round of laughter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i thank you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald bowed his head bringing the shamans boast to an ideal end.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maeog just waved his hand saying no need my young reanakt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just doing my duty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was delighted adjusting his opinion of the old fellow.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he still hated him for being a pervert and wished to grief him hard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he loved braggarts respected even.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they could never keep information to themselves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and that was of much higher priority to elrhain than some petty vengeance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he wanted to ask a few more essential questions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for example what the heck did those diagrams even mean?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but then his dad pulled him towards the far wall leaving the old shaman laughing there alone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald kneeled down to his eye level and pointed towards the murals on the wall saying with a solemn face let them dance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 15 - dance of genesis\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " let who what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald tilted his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain did the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after a few seconds his father finally realized that he forgot to explain out the details of exactly what he had to do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could almost hear the unspoken aha!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dance of prayers and blessings to the hundred thousand lakes of earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he gestured towards the lower-left corner of the wall of murals.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " start there.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then follow right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when you reach the end.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " go up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then left again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " continue until you reach the upper right side.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald tapped elrhains forehead softly with his index finger feel our ancestors commands let them in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain rubbed his left eye.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a fleck of dust must have fallen in when he had angled his head up to take in the huge wall.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he wanted to get a full view of all the murals.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a casual glance told him there were thousands of steps and tens of layers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each was drawn in ambiguous lines both simple like cave art and sophisticated like anatomical illustrations.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they depicted a ritualistic movement impossible for most humans or as his father called it a dance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " something way above his toddler bodys motor skills.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you expect me to learn all this before midnight?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if i somehow managed that i dont think i can pull the actual dance off during the rite okay?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain said incredulously.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not learn feel them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont worry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the land the spirits and our ancestors will do the rest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well that answered absolutely nothing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " um elder croneira said the shaman would explain it to meyou know what let me give it a shot first.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " seeing his fathers shoulders droop elrhain sighed and decided to humour the man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " good luck rhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald cheered up showing him the million-credit smile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then walked away leaving elrhain standing alone on the stone podium.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are all fathers puppies?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain stood there on the right edge of the giant grey stage struggling to make sense of these spirit-forsaken dances.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lets see.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " arms go like this legs go-ahg!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he plopped to the ground on his butt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im okay im okay.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " father stay there!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i can do this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when the blush at last faded from his face he was about to get up for another try but thought against it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " feel he said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain sat there with his cheeks resting on his palms and focused his gaze on the bottom-left most mural.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it looked odd unbalanced and blurry since the distance was so great like trying to see the feathers of a bird soaring in the sky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but rapidly the mural in his eyes cleared until the blurriness was all but gone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the surroundings seemed to warp a slight like a combination of fisheye and birds eye view with every pixel in focus.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he felt no discomfort.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because his brain erased out the disorientation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could see the entirety of the wall and every detail in high resolution and he could concentrate on just one particular part if he so wished.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just like how he could see the suns when he first examined them in depth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the starting line.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " feeling the waltz in the mural without the help of imitation touch or a lick was nigh impossible.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the stones didnt look particularly sterile either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he did the only thing he could.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he analyzed it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " trace it with my eyes connect the lines and try to make sense.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the first step showed two dhionne figuresone holding a staff in his hands the other carrying a jar at her hips.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was no face drawn merely a teardrop shape for the head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but elrhain could swear the figures were looking at each other.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and that looks like annie.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the thought piqued his interest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if annie was twenty cycles older.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the next mural showed the first figure slowly rotating his staff in a clockwise motion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the movements of his arms were strange physically impossible for elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if it wasnt the hands that were gripping the staff but something else.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie no the second figure whirled around the water leaving her jar in a swirling wave.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the flow hung in the air like magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they spiralled her in irregular orbits as if they were strips of ribbons with one end tied to the jar and the other end whipping gently like a fountain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the streams slowly elongated as more lines of water fell out from the clay vessel.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then they tore apart in two.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " half stayed by the woman and the other half swayed to the staff.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man inside the water curtains ran his hands through one current.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " until his hand found hers.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " wash away the past but dont let go.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the limbs the backs the chests and the heads.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everything flowed in a unique tempo like waves on a serene lake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like the snakes and fish gliding free.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it felt natural stimulating seductive and sensual.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was inviting her to a tango of creation with the void as the audience.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she peeked around and found no one there.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was lonely oh so lonely.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " huh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the limbs tangled more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it did more than tangle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the figures became one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thus there was three.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the third one left towards the discs of green.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the first two danced and the mist danced with them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " enveloping caressing like their lustful aim.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like a shawl of dim flame.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " opaque like nectar covering nothing but their shame.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " love oh sinful ones and the flowers immoral glory.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not enough were the eyes of one other so they birthed a gallery.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the void grew and the barren discs did too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " progenies life trees and fish in the lagoons.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hence they came and there was wars greedy tune.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ive seen this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but where?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the drums beat the horns blew.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the tides swept the earth of all that grew.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the water was fresh and then it was warm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like a mothers embrace a fathers loving arm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " protecting nurturing from the evil that alarmed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " something was above!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bright holy scorching!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " angels!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " figures of fire and feathers it was salvation they were forging.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they flew down tearing the void.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " raining lightning stars and the souls they toyed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " steam!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the water sizzled the blood of life rose with the earth cracked and the skies they ashed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " prayers cries screams pleading anguish hatred revenge power death and everything clashed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they came again and again and the figures cried in vain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " again again the angels campaigned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their baskets full of children and their heart-rendering cries.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their souls life and bleak hopeless eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two figures watched with nothing left behind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they cannot fight the angels had more than one measly life.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but not did their children only deaths by the knives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the figures had none so it was a futile sight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so they danced and danced and more children they romanced.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they prayed they loved and eons amassed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the crying spirits around their misty eyes aghast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unseen to the figures till the last children passed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a beast a tree a myth a beetle and a cloud blazed alight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were the first to cry and first were they to fight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " more soon came from within the hearts unite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and thus came the angels singing hymns of a harvest so ripe.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the discs darkened of life with no words and song and laughter to inscribe.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet stayed did the spirits for they had a different form of life.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of a better weaker purer more na\u00efve design.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slain by the angels but the souls survived.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but so did the angels with only two revived.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the father sang in joy and the mother sang in sorrow their hopes no longer marred.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so they danced and loved and watched and cried for the spirits that warred.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the first five died the angels did not spare.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but soon from within stronger spirits appeared.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and in this war some children were not sheared.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each time a hundred and nine times they dared.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the spirits more came more powerful than the five.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they joined in the war with the angels deprived.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and for the first time ever the angels too did die.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the figures sang in praise as the spirits rejoiced.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the progeny learnt to dance with their souls and their lives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " watched by the spirits the song of discs they voiced.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the children hid from their parents the pain their hearts hoist.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain found himself in darkness singing along with a strange song.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or was it a poem?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he did not know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the rustle of the robe on his skin was missing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the sweet smell of moss in the caverns no longer preoccupied his mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was not here in body he deduced as he watched on from far above.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his eyes saw everything like an omniscient god.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he saw the first two figures fade as thousands more appeared.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they spread from disc to disc bringing along the spirits and manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " two new figures one man and a woman danced on the disc directly below him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the spirits of the north watched contently from the waters skies and the mountains in the surrounding.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the blues greens and everything in between glowed bright about to misty surfaces.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the reds violets yellows golds and all others slept a peaceful slumber under the earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " weird why only blue?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they did not jeer or hiss as the figures tapped their foot clumsily on a dais.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they didnt leave for the eight other daises that floated on that disc.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not even for the one that blazed right in the middle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the figure there the one above the blaze moved with grace and purpose.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it wasnt dancing which the spirits surrounding him liked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was combat!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked around the void.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his disembodied vision travelled infinite distances in all directions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were thousands of bright discs like the one under my being and uncountable dark discs with no figures to be seen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he sang again but it sounded wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the jagged tune of the song made his mind recoil as if he no longer belonged here.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he decided to leave but the story hadnt ended yet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wouldnt let him go.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he once again observed all the discs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " threads in the void connected them to each other like puzzle pieces but they could never fit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his vision moved by itself to the ones with light.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each shining disc the brights had a mural of one step of an unknown dance or a strange art of war maybe?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and no discs had two.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they each had nine daises with each dais having one or more figures moving on top.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but not all brights had a dais that blazed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the discs that did have one shone brilliant with an inferno at the centre.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their dance more whole than the rest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he only counted nine discs with such blazes including his own.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the north dais was the only one that danced which dance?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain shook his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " an image like a needle pricking his brain burned him from inside.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he pushed it down and concentrated on his eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " something was begging him to watch on and he obliged.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his eyes were back to the first disc to the north dais.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other daises had their own galleries with the most bustling one indeed in the middle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the audiences were all the spawn of the first five and the stronger ones that came after.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was true for the north as well.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he observed the group of blue and green spirits surrounding the two clumsy figures.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some he knew like the snakes fishes crabs and snails.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " while the others were nameless dhionne and faediaga animals and plants and myths and monsters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two danced hysterically as if something was chasing them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but then they slowed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their forms still graceless but the spirits could see their pure souls.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so they came closer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " till the manna touched them all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the past flew away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a blessing for the clan a blessing to the disc and another to the spirits.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then four to the heavens and the earths the oceans and the voids.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain felt vigour course through his soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the pain in his mind melted like the snow in spring and the water that remained left his body unharmed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the gentle torrents then converged shaping themselves into a black star that floated above the dais.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he kept on watching as the dais became a kaleidoscope.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chants prayers and soothing howls of the spirits resounded from all around.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally the spirits had all left and the two figures sat alone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the female kneeled first followed by the male.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their hands were no longer held together.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but there were threads of blue and green and red connecting the hands they had once clasped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the threads wove in the air each passing through the black star as they did.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one final blessing this one to each other.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the black star reminded elrhain once again that these werent the figures from the start of the story.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had no staff or jar.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were foreign clumsy profane and caring.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain smiled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then the angels came.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and he woke up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 16 - the fruitgirl express elrhain sat up with a start.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his breath got caught in his lungs as he huffed and puffed coughing at the sudden shock.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the world span around and he hurriedly put his hands on the ground to steady himself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was dancing and there were weird floating creatures with no internal organs and the gigantomachy was singing epics and then the stars shot down like meteorites and everyone died like ants- a hand gently touched his shoulder and he snapped his head up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his father looked at him with eyes full of concern.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " welcome back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are you well?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what was that?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain frantically asked his hands trembled as he caught hold of his fathers sleeves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the sweat rolled down from his forehead like a waterfall while he struggled to stand up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that vision a dream from the ancestors felt like he had fallen from a thousand kilometres high with the ground nowhere to be seen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like a hypnic jerk even though he was awake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what the heck was that?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald shook his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the young man picked elrhain up from the ground and rested the hysterical boys head on his shoulders.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then turned towards maeog.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old shaman currently had his eyes closed as he meditated without sound on a mossy boulder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked no more alive than the stone he sat on but a few twitching fingers told elrhain otherwise.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " four hours and eighteen minutes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " long i would say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maeog muttered opening one eye dont bother asking your father boy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even i the grand shamanka or grand elder wont be able to explain what youve seen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each vision is unique.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " meant only for each heir or heiress of earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you alone can decipher what it showed you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only in inaugurations do the great lakes send them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old man jumped down from the rock and dropped in front of elrhain like a blur.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " depending on the event like this times spirit blessed betrothal the lakes may show you images of two different futures.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " answer me this young heir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " were we blessed?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains foggy mind started to sort itself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he came out from the frenzy and took a few deep breaths.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally with effort he nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old shaman grinned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then all is well!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain didnt think so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ewwieeee!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the moment he left the chamber with his father and thomosmaeog staying behind for more of his shamany dutiesa shadow with leafy pigtails and hair flowing behind tackled into him like a bull screaming incoherent nonsense in uorian.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ugh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains soul left his body again and he would have fallen if his father hadnt promptly supported him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie are you trying to kill me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " t-they want to make us d-dance wike that in front of people!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl sobbed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if he didnt know her actual age even he would have considered giving her a candy and take her to the lost childrens corner.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to push her off in irritation as he did now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the adults around them smiled at their antics not minding her evident violent tendencies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " was this the reason she had been talking more in uorian when people other than their family were around?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to weaponize her adorable lisp?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no they wont.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stop hugging me i cant breathe.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain tried to push the girl away again but failed her grip was too firm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he could only clear her doubts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain himself had also grumbled about this issue before leaving the chamber.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " those dancing figures got a little too passionate at times.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were children for all that is morals sake!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he would rather die again than have a mark of public indecency on his name.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he asked the shaman and his father cautiously if he had to dance exactly like so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two didnt know why elrhain was so flustered or why he kept beating around the bush trying to ask a question.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maeog even called him cute smartarse for being shy the old man ending up with another blasting laughter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but just take the jar and staff to the alter and the ancestors will teach you the rites.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " also never before was there an heir who had to actually dance or do anything of the sort really.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was always more like a metaphor the dance of blessings.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " weally?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn visibly relaxed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then giggled as she patted his face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you wuk like rafiki!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you look like miramarja scribbled on your face again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they both giggled remembering agwyns bratty grandniece from hell.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that girl had a mission to be the greatest prankster the collective had ever seen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to be honest elrhain was as relieved as a cloud reuniting with the girl despite his complaints.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the physical discomfort and mental strain the slight ache inside him whispering that something was missing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were gone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vanished into puffs of smoke the moment agwyn rammed into him with the force of a truck.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " perhaps those feelings were the very reason why she kept squeezing him so hard right now?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his head cleared up like the sky after a rain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the frenzy couldnt stop him from thinking anymore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the cogs turned and keys clicked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the questions flooded his mind from the deep psyche as if they had been waiting impatiently like preschoolers before summer vacation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dance lewdly she said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain mused but wasnt each vision unique?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe it isnt if we do the rite together?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but we had one vision and not two unlike what maeog said!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do all heirs have to get engaged when they get initiated?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no that would be ridiculous.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he broke out of his speculations when he saw agwyn scuttle back towards elder croneira who watched the cavern outside the corridor pillars with a contemplative expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and as he predicted cyra stood beside her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the extraordinary woman with water below the waist was also wearing ceremonial clothes identical to dofnalds in design.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so the mans father and wifes mother?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " did this tradition come from the gender restrictions on these chambers or did the traditions come first?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain saw his father politely bow towards the two.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra was joking around with everyone in the vicinity even servant thomos.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the meek servant talking so candidly looked remarkably at ease while speaking with the chieftainess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that made elrhains eyebrows twitch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why was he so jumpy with me then?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all right elder croneira clapped there is not a lot of time until the midnight moon unveils.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the heiress and the heir took three hours longer than we had expected.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how will the chieftainess and reanakt siaglas bring the two above in time?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald and cyras demeanor changed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my that is a dilemma.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra then giggled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " good thing we have me!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she glanced towards dofnald and threw him a wink.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats not enough lady.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain groaned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " three winks later cyra realized dofnald didnt pick up her meaning.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so she puffed her cheeks saying skies can fly duh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " was all his father said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then gave the chieftainess a nod.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " great!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman cheered and picked up her daughter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as did dofnald with elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mommy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn called out in confusion when cyra tied the girl to her body with filaments of water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they went up and around the little girls robes but didnt press down tight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn didnt look uncomfortable either simply strumming the filaments like a guitar string.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a mellow twang rang out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " father should be dying of boredom having to sit with those squabbling lesser nobles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the grand shamanka should have readied the alter by now too cyra kissed her daughters nose while talking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the best part is the feast cannot commence until the clan hath been blessed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " clan traditions strictly require them to fast today until the ceremony ends.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " those yuriel pretenders and clan zealots should be blowing their tops in hunger by now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder croneira facepalmed chieftainess this is no time for jokes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and you lot what are you laughing at!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the servants who were eavesdropping in ran away like a headless flock of chickens.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they seemed livelier than the servants elrhain saw in lochuir and the other settlements.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " definitely not like the fidgety ones who served in their own courtyard three cycles ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i know i was just wondering is all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the way lord siaglas would you mind tying this aqua-vine to yourself and little rhain?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it will be safer that way.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain saw his fathers finger jerk.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the man still received the extended appendage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few seconds after that when dofnald had tied an initial knot the aqua-vine flew in by itself and wrapped around both of them snugly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain gave the closest one to his face a lick.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it tasted like fruit pulp.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he licked some more.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " i can hardly understand it my good lords.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " how can one of such lowly bloods be worthy of our spirit gifted princess who bears the finest intrinsic manna-born crests and cultivation roots on her person?!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the antlered dhionne shot a questioning glance at thundham with the other elders on the left gasping out loud their shocked drawn-out exclamations in various dramatic poses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the haughty lords of his dominion were far more dissatisfied by the clans' choice of heir consort than he thought.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but complain as they might the three leaders decision of heir consort will never be taken back once finalized.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well in this case to those outside of the main house the heiress and heir consort would have to be respectfully addressed as princess and prince consort.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham almost chuckled at the thought imagining these folks who put pride before life having to refer to a former servant's son in a subservient manner.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " truth to be told he too was once vastly disappointed in elrhain's potential especially that in cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the status of a servant wasn't an issue.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " many a time the clan accepted the marriage of talented lowborn men and women with their scions.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " last but not least of the frames he could actually form in the future the circles looked more like rhombuses and the triangles were never not skewed in the weirdest possible directionsthe twisted channels from one node to another seemed like they had love affairs with nineteen other nodes in the neighbourhood.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " an extremely mild affinity for wood earth and water and even that was a cluttered-up wreckage with fluctuating aspects of soul mind and flesh magic trying to vie for dominance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to mention the ichoric chamber in his heart was as scraggy as a cracked eggshell.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had the lowest farmhand servant's capability through and through with no actual path or technique of cultivation in the clan's archives that he could follow.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the sole redeeming quality he had was the tethered totemic soulas recently identified by the grand shamanka he shared with agwyn.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man a powerhouse far above sky with a lifespan spanning thousands of cycles had died of grief not seven days after his sky realmer wife had passed away of old age.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if his granddaughter was a genius that would make the current yuriel impelakty green in envy this would still be her destiny.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the disc had blessed her a high affinity in all the nature's elements with innate manna-born crests covering her body a spirit's ichoric chamber a marrow core harder than the hardest metal known to dhionne and the flesh of a faediaga.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally the tethered totemic soul far more symmetrical than her fated's with deeper nodes more elegant lattice and well-aligned frames.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " indeed her totem in the future would be anything but ordinary with such a magnificent set of roots.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the soil was simply too fertile for a harvest to fail even if she tried.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " although she was not a supreme talent in any of her roots she only had a marginally less breakthrough possibility.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a supreme was all but assured of breaking through the last circle and were the envy of all.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " in contrast agwyn had more roots than the whole clan could poke a stick at.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with earthloch's resources her breakthrough beyond the sky was all but assured.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so if she the clan's hope and future passed away of grief like the yuriel founder would his son and cyra have to risk their lives again to sire another inheritor?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " no!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he would never allow it.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he loved them both as a family should.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to mention that child was a bona fide supreme.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was because that child had the blood of the royalty of a foreign hostile disc.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the child's mother was a war prisoner of war whom his nephew released in the blind name of love.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had to give up achievements and concede war spoils of the last disc war to stop the other high nobles from forcefully executing the father and child.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in nobility terms that was the same as begging and kneeling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " an enemy's royal blood having legitimacy on uorys diosca?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the clans and dominions of the other seventeen juyakts eleven eyrshakts four siorrakts two diuvakts and the impelakt would see the earthlochs razed before that happened.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had virtually given up hope that day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nearly ordered elrhain to be bounded into a necromantic vessel transmuted into a small living bead by the naeman witches who lived in the boundary of disc and void.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn would never meet her fated face to face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she might never love another but one didn't require love to sire children.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " responsibility was sufficient for that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " better still she would not fall to suicide or an untimely death either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since her fated would live right by her side as a ghoulish accessory.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it had been merely a few hours since the babes were born and the boy's father and mother had not yet laid their eyes on him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham would frame it as a tragedy like so many others in the clan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the babe was weak ill and eventually died uncrying unbreathing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn would never find out either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she would live on with an eternal ache in her heart not knowing why she woke up every night to weep her soul out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but she would live and that was enough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not even her parents would inform her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why should they when the result was the girl most certainly ending her own life?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no he alone would atone for the sin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he would ennoble a pailakty to the lovely eluned and brave dofnald in penitence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then he would sacrifice his very life to the tainted disc-eater haar'zhist the frigid wormgod down below with an eternity to suffer in the beings infinite poisonous stomach.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham's fears had spiralled out of control the darkness in his head feeding the devil's mirth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was then that the grand shamanka another of the sky realmers of his clan and his maternal aunt by bloodeven though he was older by age persuaded him to cross the cavern when they got there.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he relented no less than an hour of spittle flying one clash of sword and staff and a psychological breakdown later.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " his granddaughter was everything her talent promised.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " barely three cycles now yet already halfway to earthen with her nodes filling up almost as if the disc was pushing manna into them.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " his natural progress in cultivation was just as he had predicted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he merely had forty-one specks ignited even with all the superior elixirs he gobbled up each meal like a fish-gremlin with an unceasing appetite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his wisdom on the other hand was unorthodox to say the least.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " brilliant if thundham was to praise it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " glints of revelation in his daily talks with a lisping agwyn his commentaries on the nature of the world and reactions to everyday mundane details of the clan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how he rebuked bromwyn's mistakes as a chieftain when they discussed clan matters during their suppers even though anybody else would believe bromwyn right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was as if he regarded the world around him from a bird's perspective.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " noticing obvious details they had all been missing for hundreds no thousands of cycles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " others would mock him a loon mad in the head.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham would not.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because in his childhood he was the same!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now all those who derided him looked on in reverence as the nine great lakes of the hundreds he dug up with but a few trusted companions sprouted spirits of their own and fed the clan with thousands of gheist manna-cores and spirit spawn ichors every cycle.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " his grandson-in-law was a thinker!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just like him and like the star-seers of yore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their forefathers have blessed him with sagely wisdom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nothing like those fake scholars of the yuriels who had not the eyes to understand the truth of the world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so what if his talent was worse?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were the earthlochs!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the strongest siorrakt the greatest noble after the yuriels!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had more talents in brawn than they needed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but thinkers they had so pitifully few.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if elrhain had no skill to fight or cultivate they would throw more elixirs at him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if even that was not adequate it only meant they threw too few elixirs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " history has shown that dhionne could break through beyond the sky with nothing but wealth and the earthlochs had the wealth to replicate that feat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was the grand elder his son was the siorrakt his daughter-in-law a great faediaga eldress.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had the right and authority to use the clan treasury however they pleased.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to mention the grand shamanka who had been complaining incessantly about how she could not meet the two children because of her duties.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who else had the qualifications to oppose his decision?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who would dare directly challenge him for explanations?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham would applaud them first before crushing them into bone gruel.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thus he answered not elder sonora's unworded questions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " 'that spineless coward.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham just listened.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was aged and weary but hardened.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sometimes senile coming to hasty conclusions.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is our holy task to point out all his mistakes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " replied elder sonora with a mocking grin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but an unwed woman like you have no way of understanding the gravity of our obligations towards clan and family nor the proper manner to speak to your betters onthoakt gairmsnarl.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you should learn some from onthoakt ursan if he is even willing to teach you.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " you wear the robes of the impelakty you paint totems in their practice on your body and you wed no sell your daughter out for a price of manna-core like a naeman trader against long-standing clan traditions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the lowest farmhand servant of earthloch has higher rights to sit here than a renegade like you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " surely you jest lord sabhalan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am simply doing my duty by rectifying our outdated traditions and bringing a much-needed progressive change to the ways of earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a wise man knows that stubbornly clinging onto unneeded customs is the true obstacle that stops meaningful progress.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the scholars of the impelakty have proven this time and time again and yet you as a pailakt still cannot grasp that meaning.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora closed his eyes and slowly shook his head left and right as if he had never seen anything more tragic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " pailakt sabhalan laughed raising all four of his arms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hear this my good brothers and sisters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora here declares that he is too embarrassed to show the practices of our ancestors openly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if we let this renegade be more sacrilegious what next will he say?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that womenfolks have no rights to a title or to be warriors and should remain behind walls bearing children and obeying their husbands?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he preaches yuriel tradition right to our faces on this sacred ceremony of our earthloch princess!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that won a solid round of cheers and salutes from the dhionnes on the right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even thundham couldn't help acknowledging that point.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora's disdain towards womenfolk could not affect the sentiments of the clan right now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet he knew that many generations ago the yuriels too were also not like they are today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course he never showed a shred of his inner thoughts outwards.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just staring at the altar expressionlessly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he and the grand shamanka had planted it on the highest surface of the loch sagathan temple earlier that day with only the starloch spire floating above.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora on the other hand was the opposite of silent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his snort resounded like an avalanche and the derisive sneer on his face warped into a furious scowl as he snarled do not twist my words cave savage!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i merely speak of discarding the old and bringing in the new!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet i fear concepts like these will sound like hymns of yore to one such uneducated as you.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you hear that my brothers and sisters of earthloch how he scorns me by my ancestry and not by my deeds!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you see him repressing me with his self-entitled impelakty rights?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " palaikt sabhalan shot back hoisting the skull full of aged fruit pulp in elder sonora's direction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time the dhionnes sitting on the left were the ones who raised their fists and wings in complaints.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and so it continued on and on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like children fighting in the mud pits over who gets to keep the shiniest rock.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham thought it might have been the long wait that agitated these monkey brains.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " although hmm?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the moons aligned on the apex as the midnight stars flickered brightly.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " perhaps it was the adrenaline high from that heck of a roller coaster ride as she was having trouble controlling her emotions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that was fine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she learnt that bottling up her explosive adult feelings in this tiny toddlers body would only cause her pain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " both physical and psychological.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " insomnia was the least bad the worst case being that time she practically had a mental breakdown one day thinking she had multiple personalities clashing in her psyche.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so she learned to let loose.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " let her petite body with its itty-bitty biology do its work.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " inside her soul far removed from the control of her hormones and neuroreceptors she still had the judgement and values of an adult human individual.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but on the surface she wanted and needed to live a joyous life as a 3-cycle old dhionne who suckled on her thumb and cried owie when someone pinched her puffy cheeks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or how else could she speak such cheesy pick-up lines to elrhain so confidently?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the adult agwyn was cold selfish spiteful and sceptical.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she would rather swallow a swordfish live on telenet wearing a ballet tutu than loudly proclaim her feelings like that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unless she was dead drunk or on drugs of course.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but then again gene-mods made detoxifying them almost effortless and she hated virtual reality the only place where she was able to suppress the mods without harm.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " you have an annoying lisp for christs sake okay maybe not all of them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn shut her mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but she loved how he switched to earth common when he scolded her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so thoughtful even when angry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain rarely got angry in his past life.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after she had wailed in this simple fact for the last thirty cycles today for the first time in her life she glimpsed the tail of a different answer in the sea of despair.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as elusive as a lake spirit in water the answer was still shrouded in dark reefs and murky swirls but it was certainly there.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she heard its fins cut through the currents smelled its delicate scent of flesh and almost reached it with her minds extended hands.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned pushed it down and swam up to the light more out of shame than in purpose.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the devils of despair chased after her the like leeches out for blood.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but eluned didnt look back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she did not want to show that face now of all places with the noble lords and ladies watching her every move judging her to spot new a weakness they could latch onto.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned lifted her head slowly and examined the various groups of nobles lords and ladies gathering the stage.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " no matter how unsightly their current state was.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some nobles were fuming red in embarrassment or rage some were dead intoxicated with their heads nose deep in pots of aged fruit pulp.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one ladys face morphed into a beastly scowl as her flat eyes reflected the hands of a man and woman clasped together while another had a depraved smirk as she frothed droplets of lust in a certain wedded lords direction a pink tipsy light in her eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few other nobles stared up towards the thousands of fireflies in the sky with unhidden dread washing their face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " others looked so ecstatic they had to stop themselves from jumping up into the skies to catch a few specks of light for their own.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluneds eyes caught it all and the world seemed to clear up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she tilted her head in confusion the darkness behind her practically retreating like a kicked puppy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why can they show the faces i always tried so desperately to hide away?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned pondered some more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now she really wasnt a servant.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with that thought finally sunk deep into her psyche possibilities she was utterly oblivious to opened their doors.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned had both material and spiritual opportunities that were unimaginable to her ten cycles ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a lover she knew who sought not her body but her heart a son and daughter she could play with day and night and in-laws who cared for her far more than her own siblings and parents did.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned placed her palms above her heart.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the constant throb had sped up like a raging heated kaloxens.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she sensed it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the answer to all her woes and misery was closer than ever before.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her spine shivered with a kind of euphoria as she involuntarily glanced up at the sky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the lacerated firmament told her to look deep within one more time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what do i need to protect us?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she didnt sense it in her minds sea anymore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it had escaped!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so she hunted for it in the beam of light that had just flickered to darkness in the panicking lords and ladies who all stood up acting as if their fate was no longer in their hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she searched in the choir of prayers that resulted where the voices of servants nobles and freemen all blended together.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just because they have prettier rocks smoother pelt more colourful feathers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned grabbed hold of one tiny fibre of the answer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just a little more and she would have it!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her face turned crimson and the sights and buzzes around her faded to a bleak grey so that solely the most important part of the world would reflect on her senses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally some things began to colour themselves again in the monotone world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when the wind turned radiant as the flood of manna lead by a hundred thousand spirits tided upon the lands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when the clamour of the mighty nobles died down as if they too had turned as meek as a servant surrendering their life to a master they could not name.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when she saw father thundham soar into the sky towards the temple like a dragon with the other nobles following him on the ground like little birdlings who knew not how to fly.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " for their own familys heir too he would have the boy take a concubine with higher talent than that agwyn cyra earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " preferably a graceful dame from the yuriel impelakty practising the nephilim birth cultivation technique.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would kill three fliers with one pebble.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bring the earthloch main house and their own palaikt family closer together forge stronger bonds with the scholars of the yuriels and ultimately keep a sonora heir who would be stronger than the main houses.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " what bond could be closer?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would be the perfect gateway to revolutionize the entire clan from within discard those laughable old practices and embrace true modernity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he had tried to let his stubborn old aunt witness his grand vision with logical reasoning fate given proof and lettered deductions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all he got in return was a severe beating he had not experienced since his own father was the palaikt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bevin almost vomited blood just remembering that event.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his heart swelled with discontent at how blind every single one of the three leaders was.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is until today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when bevin laid his eyes upon the princess for the first time during this late noon he had nearly fainted in shock.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " almost died during birth?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what high deception croneira gellen earthloch and remarkably well played.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was as if the spirits had moulded the little girl themselves sculpting all the superlative qualities of dhionne and faediaga into one tiny body.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " was she a supreme?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no her various cultivation roots didnt appear so profoundly unique in his totem the crimson tears of the thousand eyes not like his grandsons.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had seen the departed stormfelts heir too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that boys shadows alone convinced him why the last circle was considered nothing but a stick and vine blockade to supreme talents.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all of the princesss many roots were merely the best excluding supremes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but couple that with the sheer number of cultivation roots she possessed and it painted an altogether different picture.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " according to the storytellers the earthloch founder was precisely like the princess and hadnt he easily broken through the last circle easily?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bevin realized he was such a fool!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how could he claim to his aunt that the princess was less in talent?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no wonder she was so infuriated.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then bevin laid his eyes upon the prince consort and thunder clapped in his ears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " simply despicable!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what manner of trickery did the newly named siaglas use to engage their dreg of a son to the princess?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the events after midnight both solidified his resolve and enlightened him with the last clue to perfect his new and improved proposal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the princess had received the gifts of all but one of their hundred thousand great lake spirits.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " she cannot still have the faulty judgement to uphold the princesss marriage with a low-blooded now can she?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bevin hastened his pace pumping more manna into his back and legs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the grand elder was a speck in the sky by now descending upon the top of loch sagathan temple by flight.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " sometimes he too could not help but feel how unfair sky realmers were.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he knew his own talent and breaking the seventh circle to the sky in his lifetime would be as difficult as scaling the disc on foot as a mortal.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the smells and sounds of nature dimmed and distorted until nothing but the scorching winds remained.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bevin jumped with all the momentum he had mastered and the moons in the sky seem to move closer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were a few seconds of tranquil silence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only in moments like these could he truly be alone with his thoughts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he took the respite to tidy up any loose ends of his plan and when he was at last satisfied his feet once again touched the ground.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dust clouded up around the spot where he landed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he punched the stone foundation of the temple gates to dissipate the momentum.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet he was intricate in his arts and not even a pebble of the ruined gate was further damaged.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the time he stood up straight with the confidence oozing from his body a series of thumps had thudded behind him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his brothers in arms the enlightened of the letters and the lords of the western lakes had followed him to support his just cause.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bevin could not stop his mouth curling up into an earnest smile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he would not betray their trust.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " those eastern lake savages claim we follow the words of the yuriel scholars blindly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bevin changed his gait into that of elder sonoras and his smile reformed into something loftier.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so let us prove them wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he knew very well that a decision carried out by the grand elder the grand shamanka and the chieftain would never be reversed in ordinary times.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the times would be anything but ordinary come sunrise.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the collapse would force the clan to progress forward without a halt in steps or perish!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hence the decision could be altered slightly rather than abjured.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if the three leaders indeed had the clans future in their hearts they wouldnt mind adding a few passages to the betrothal scroll of the princess would they?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the smile on his face stretched bigger.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he realized that simple progress was not adequate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it also had to be unique.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the yuriels say a man of power must have more than one mate and a woman of faith must share her powerful man with many sisters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the blood of the strong must pass down and the blood of the weak must be eliminated.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " women are to be admired like our great manna-rioghs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they sacrifice their body and cultivate hard to sire more talented offspring.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only the strongest of men are worthy of owning a womans womb.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or else it would be unfair to the clan sister and daughters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if the circumstances drove her to sire a child with an untalented waste?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how bleak would such a future be?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora had always found logic in those scholarly words.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had even urged his own daughter to take up the yuriel method for female cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at first she was indignant as most women of earthlochs tend to be.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but in the end she had seen her fathers care and agreed to sire a child with one yuriel palaikt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course she would never be the principal wife.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she would suffer a bit but her sacrifice had now paid off.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the best part was those yuriel nobles will never know what they missed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonoras daughter had unexpectedly returned to the clan six cycles ago crying they called me a sow honoured father.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that i sold my chastity to steal yuriel bloodlines!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i would rather die than give my body to that viper again!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora had lamented seeing her anguished visage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " perhaps compelling his earthloch bred daughter to live the lifestyle of the impelakty was an incorrect decision?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he immediately threw that thought away when his grandson was birthed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no he slightly changed that thought.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as he would change the leaders decisions from now on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his grandson was all the proof he needed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " such elegance like the mythical phoenix!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " such blazing blood like the summer sohwl!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " such eminent spirit like a sea of lava!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy had both vindicated his choice of adhering to the yuriels scholarly methods and planted a seed of doubt in his mind towards how the yuriel nobles themselves handled their own ideology.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after all they had failed in making his daughter a part of their clan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it simply meant that the yuriels were the untalented party in the marriage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a fortune on a stormy day that his pregnant daughter had the foresight to travel back home despite the thousands of kilometres of treacherous paths separating the two dominions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " indeed women were not to be underestimated.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he vowed to conduct himself hereafter and to never show any unjust disdain towards them again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because elder sonora strode forward pride singing in his every footstep.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his smile didnt dwindle in the slightest when he neared the chieftain who sat cross-legged on the rubbled ground in front of the ruined gates.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we are not the yuriels!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora stared down at the burly man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the discrepancy of power between them became apparent at a glance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the nervous chattering of the crowd the stink of worry and uncertainty of the dhionne could not take away the pride in the burly mans might.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the chieftain loomed over everyone and everything in the vicinity even though he was sitting down with eyes closed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no one not even the reckless palaikt sabhalan or he himself would dare to ignore him and walk around the dilapidated gate pillars to the place where the chieftainess stood alongside that low-blooded siaglas deceiver.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but power mattered not right now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his plan was one that would take time and effort.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " planting a seed in the chiefs mind did not require him to be stronger only wiser.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora steadied his composure reigning in the pride and surfacing his deference.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because untamed pride was a manifestation of regressive customs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and we are earthlochs!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we are the most progressive.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn opened his eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " those giant lilac swirls held a promise of brutality and retribution.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora knew that the chieftain had not the greatest of opinions about himself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mainly because of unfortunate past events.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but this time it would be different.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora replayed the princesss blessed deeds and his own daughters bravery in his mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they favoured him with power and he would from now strive to repay all of them a hundredfold!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we will let our women too become the owners of many manna-rioghs!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they would swim through the collapse that is to come unharmed under the leadership of the princess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she would unify all talented houses with the vow of marriage and the earthlochs would become the greatest clan on the disc.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 23 - ignition\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lochuir was in chaos.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone servants freemen and nobles alike had clambered down from the ridges left the stages and ran out from their dwellings in both fear and hope.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they gathered in front of the gates of the loch sagathan temple where bromwyn and his cousins the main house elders and shamans blocked their path to the thousand steps with cold resolve.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as the siorrakt he would not allow a nervous mob to ruin todays holy rite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet despite the obvious warning in his eyes he could sympathize with his subjects.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dhionne men women children and old waited for his grand-aunt and father to come down.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " only in their guidance would they find the resolve to scare away the fear of an unknown future.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he saw the nobles take in deep breaths.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they tried and failed to hold their trembling hands still some in horror some in glee.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of the freemen some glanced at the nobles with clear avarice in their gaze and some peered at the exit to the lochuir township in unease.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the servants only fidgeted about not even knowing what to do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " regardless they all either cried or cheered or stared blankly up at the sky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone there including bromwyn knew exactly of one fact.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a new era had arrived.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because the tide of blessing had left behind not merely visions of prosperity but also prophecies of destruction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone had heard the stories.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the fearful ones knew what to expect but not what to do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the smart ones were already forming plans.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " scheming even if they were opportunistic enough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like the antlered man in front of him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora talked on and on about ideology and whatnot.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " most of which went in one of bromwyns ears and left through the other.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " until he started hinting about concubine candidates for his little gwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old man even had the gall to suggest it as something the clan could not do without.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " did he not eat grass today?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why is he so damn excited?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " time and place uncle bevin youve lived too long to forget that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn cracked his neck as threateningly as he could while blasting out an annoyed sigh which came out louder than alleighs roars.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and to his joy elder sonoras narration halted with the older man taking a few steps back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet after but a second his composure returned and he was about to go on praising how his grandson burnt hotter than a wildfire.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally found his spine did he?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn was shocked at the unnaturally brave front of the old man who should be a spineless wimp.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " either way he tried to spook him one more time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn cracked his neck again in the other direction then slammed the rubbled ground with his palms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his cousin and aid cadwell looked at him with slanted eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but bromwyn ignored that surprised that his second attempt at scaring off the coward had also failed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " usually at this stage the antlered man would scamper away like a babe by himself spouting high sounding threats.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn always appreciated a dhionne finding their gallant inner selves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but spirits help him when the same only turned elder sonora a hundred times more vexing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had to keep his hands steady from punching the buffoon in half.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after all it was elder sonoras fault his little princess had gone to the ritual angry at daddee.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stop!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn gritted his teeth and tried to replace agwyns pouting face with a cheerful one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it only caused him to hate himself which definitely wasnt the time to place such thoughts in his mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its unbecoming.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not now bromwyn not now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he failed spectacularly and his stern visage involuntarily melted into a full-faced doughy-eyed grin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my valiant gwyn is so cute when she is angry too!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it took one disappointed tsk from cadwell and elder sonora at last jolting his head away in horror that bromwyn realized what he had done.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he coughed loudly to distract them hurriedly composing himself from that shameful expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but now that the antlered man had lost his spine againas he should be bromwyn spoke with a booming voice striking the iron while it was hot.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora i hear and will give thought.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but maybe now isnt the proper time for this suggestion?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after all my daughter had just gotten betrothed!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " gheistfurs!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how rude of me my lord!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonoras face paled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or did it get brighter actually?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh spirits.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i should not have responded to him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyns fears came true when sonora knelt down with the poise of a martyr shouting i will kowtow on the sharp stones until the grand shamanka and grand elder descends to atone for my follies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it gives my heart nothing but hope that you will deign to even think about my untimely suggestion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and all his cronies followed shouting the same thing like a nest of talkabirds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn facepalmed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was always like this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whether this man was a coward or not didnt matter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he would always always try to ruin everyone but his own fun.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when bromwyn had gotten inaugurated as heir they came to him beating drums and clapping rocks with their jade skinned learnt in the crafts of arts sisters and daughters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn scoffed certainly onthoakt laerocks sister was jade skinned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when bromwyn steeled himself to wed the far stronger far older cyra elder sonora returned again to propose the thousand reasons why cyra should accept five other ladies into their matrimony to her face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the marriage was itself quite precarious at that time since it was out of convenience and obligation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyras faediaga flock would never marry their eldress off like that if their survival wasnt hinging on it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that was that and this was this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora single-handedly turned cyras poor impression of bromwyn to the absolute worst impression in a matter of minutes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyras flock even accused him of dishonouring the ancient pacts of lou and earthloch that he was taking advantage of the lou flock now that he knew cyra was at his mercy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that was the first time in his life he had felt killing intent towards a clan member.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it took cycles of pampering to each of his wifes many ridiculous fancies to mend that initial impression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn predicted that elder sonoras zeal to progress the clan would be absolutely unbearable this time and bromwyn might actually murder the antlered man if he got the chance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as unvaliant as that would be sometimes as one of the clan leaders he had to make the hard choices.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " during bromwyns fathers ritual only seven hundred and fifty-four spirits blessed the clan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was one thousand two hundred and ninety-eight during his.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was only a light manna shower in both cases.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time the heavens collapsed and a hundred thousand spirits sauntered their way in like they owned the place.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would not surprise bromwyn if elder sonora and his cronies called forth all the unwed noble bachelors in the western lakes regardless if they were six cycles old or sixty and order them to vie for little gwyns hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " last time they could force nothing drastic on the sky realmer cyra as that would only lead to unnecessary deaths.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time they might think the siaglas reanakty was helpless to refuse their demands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they might even find a chance to threaten the gullible eluned while dofnald was not there or scheme a hundred other sinister tricks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the very thought gave bromwyn a headache.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " neither he dofnald or cyra could do anything more about eluneds timidity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so bromwyn would simply let the meek woman be.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he as chieftain would have his own house look after the young siaglas reanakty until they had enough strength to defend themselves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was fortunate that dofnald was talented enough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as he was brooding in his thoughts a few shadows suddenly flickered on bromwyns face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the wind around had gone eerily stiff but he seemed to be the only one to notice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he clapped his palms sending out not only an avalanche of echoes but also a demand for silence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn stood up stretching his arms and legs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after a few eye contacts with cadwell and his other clan siblings he turned around and bowed as humbly as he could towards the stairs leading to the sky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a hundred paces in front of him dofnald and cyra did the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the crowd finally noticed the two grand figures coming down like deities and followed bromwyns actions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like a field of flowers closing bloom from north to south with but a breaths interval.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rise the grand shamankas voice resounded like the muffled thunder on a stormy night.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she stood in the fore her shawls of manna drifting uncaring like her titanic might.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his father stood after protecting the two adorable gremlins poking out from behind his legs from any ill gazes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn huffed in relief.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " seeing them both safe and sound after experiencing such a cataclysmic collapse as the vanguard for their clan even with such petite bodies gave rise to both unfettered pride and cold dread in his heart.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as long as they are fine it is enough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his heartbeat steadied with all the annoyance from elder sonoras tirades now forgotten.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as such he could concentrate his ear on lilians proclamations.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could use the guidance as much as his clansmen would after what had transpired tonight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dear brothers and sisters of my clan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilians voice went up a few more octaves yet did not lose its signature chime.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " today i stand before you with a heavy heart but also a heart full of anticipation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all of you have seen the blessing our prince and princess the siaglas heir and earthloch heiress called forth.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " haste with our mandates to your homes and bring back your family.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " send out messengers to all corners of earthloch and the disc far beyond.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the elixir herbs will sprout from the ground like weeds after rain and there will be manna-cores in even the weakest of gheists for us to harvest!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian roared.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just like that the fear sizzled away like fire in the rain replaced by dreams of grandeur.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn could feel the tension rise with every word the grand shamanka uttered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she expertly painted a victorious vision of the future.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for nobles it was cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for freemen it was nobility.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and for the servants?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was freedom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the breathing of the crowd grew heavier once more but this time the tempo was different.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was a nasally panting fast unsteady and impatient.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian continued raising her staff up high.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other clans and tribes will dare not step a single foot on our lands for they cower in the might of our ancestral blessing!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lest they be cursed by the spirits of our guardian lakes for stealing what is ours!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " so they will envy us insult us that we are trapped like prey with the gheists and the rioghs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the truth is that the gheists and rioghs are trapped here with us!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and not the other way around!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so when the next generations come we will reveal ourselves to the disc far stronger.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont like the noise they make at night.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was the third dispute since morning.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " an episode like this would not refuse any dhionne group entry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because it was the clan who had called upon them to unite their strengths in the first place.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " earthloch needed all the muscle and manpower they could afford for the imminent collapse.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what were a few rowdy younglings?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn scrunched up her nose as she witnessed all that then started biting her nails.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after you went to sleep yesterday daddy said it will take a whole cycle for everyone to arrive.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but an uorys diosca cycle is like um three thousand days?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at this rate thats like three million more dhionne being stuffed inside this one valley.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont think so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wasnt grandpa debating building more huts and longhouses on other mountains with the big guy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they will probably just expand the residential areas.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats good.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " come to think of it the clan has two-and-a-half dhionne for every lake according to auntie lilian.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then this degree of immigration wont continue for long right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i reckon the ones living within the borders of the siorrakty should make up the vast majority of that population.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if what lilian said was right thats only two hundred and fifty thousand heads.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they should arrive within a season at the current rate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then pointed to a few eye-catching travellers in the line.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they either stood alone or only with a small party.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each had scary-looking weapons and a battle-hardened disposition.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the typical dhionne groups usually gave them a wide berth except the oddly curious children.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " they wander all over uorys diosca in search of power fame and adventure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in fact they do look like adventurers from fantasy video games and rpgs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what do you think?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn excitedly nodded her head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you think we can be one when we grow up?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but she drooped her shoulders a second later mommy said the collapse will last for a hundred cycles at the least.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hells first the courtyard now this!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is my second life going to be one detention after another?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eh stop whining.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " speaking of a hundred cycleselrhain chided her then placed a finger on his temples thoughtfully.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " will we still be alive by then?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well you will since everyones praising you for all those talents in cultivation thingies andwait wait i will be too okay?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i can come up with some uber cultivation technique using earth science that suits me perfectly so dont cry!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after cooing the girl for what felt like hours she finally unburied her face from her palms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn quickly wiped the snot and tears away with the hemp of her robe.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her smile was both shy and forced.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these days elrhain wondered if agwyn let her young body dictate too many of her actions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " talking to her was like walking on a tightrope sometimes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain coughed to clear his throat before bringing her attention back to the disc-walkers again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as i was saying i bet your father calculated how long most of the disc-walkers would take to return when he said one whole cycle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they first have to learn about the word of the collapse from wherever they were then make their way back tens of thousands of kilometres by foot or by beast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that reminds me agwyns eyes were still a bit misty and red.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the girl tried hard not to show her inner emotions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was now peering intently at some brachiosaurus-like gheists their heads moving out of the canopy like scrawny shark fins slicing the sea.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " will the clan close the borders after this cycle?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn shook her head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i dont think so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " daddy said that the manna-rioghs will go berserk come next summer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that the gheistrums roaming outside will be too dangerous for lone travellers to cross the mountains.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so if they can actually make the journey in such conditions theres no reason to turn them away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain rubbed his nose.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " an aroma of roast meat and fruit drifted up with the wind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some groups were preparing their meals on makeshift firepits.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " any disc-walker who can fight their way back is a tremendous asset.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still he tried to guess what kind of meat was being roasted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it smelled like both beef and tuna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i cant believe we actually caused all of this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or maybe it was just agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as much as she likes to deny it shes the one who literally received 99.999 of the gifts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not that i am pushing the blame on her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a visage of a friendly old man flashed past elrhains mind at the thought grandpa thundham says it was mainly me though.delusional old man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had a hard time accepting that claim.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " most of the earthloch clan nobles attributed the rift in the sky that night to agwyn alone and he somewhat agreed with that sorry lot.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian's clever manipulation shifted the merit partially to elrhain primarily because of how heated the crowd was during her speech on the night of the ritual.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they just wanted to hear good things back then like a pep talk before the apocalypse.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain didnt know how long that diversion would last.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " people tended to turn merits into faults when things dont go the way they hoped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they might still attribute the good things to agwyn just because she was the princess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as for the bad stuff.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a former servants child like him whose family was ennobled under mysterious circumstances was the perfect scapegoat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hed been blamed for less in his past life.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 25 - summer starvation\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the ritual on that fateful night had turned the lives of all dhionne in the clan upside down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had to leave behind their ancestral homes the uncountable memories both good and bad they had with the lands and lakes of their native settlements to travel to an unfamiliar place hundreds or even thousands of miles away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the journey wasnt particularly safe either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a close loved one dying was a genuine possibility.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the noble houses would not have as much say in lochuir as they did in their own territories.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the freemen would have to sacrifice a lot of the freedom they or their forefathers toiled so hard to obtain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the servants would gripe at how their safe daily routines got ripped to shreds by two blabbering kids.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as ignorant as they were even with an iota of common sense they should be able to guess that their lives would only get more complicated from now on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " almost all servants were but mortal realmers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ones like dofnald who crossed the first circle before adulthood without the resources of a noble house were few and far between.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " high and mighty cultivators could benefit significantly from high-level gheist cores and other elements the collapse would bring.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but for the majority of servants?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they couldnt even fathom what 100 cycles actually entailed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so far the reality of their lives had taught them that they had nothing to do with concepts such as the glory of the clan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they didnt have the luxury nor leisure so most of them never bothered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a days worth of food a simple shelter and maybe the protection of the master household in times of danger was enough for them to be content in their meagre lives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet from now they would have to work harder but receive even less in return.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wont take long for even the dullest of servants to see the unfairness if elrhain judged them by similar cases from back on earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however because they were so used to that unfairness they couldnt even complain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were the perfect example of learned helplessness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however heck even if they dont think it unfair they will at least feel that something is wrong right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if thats how it has always been it has never been this bad.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their grievances would fester like a plague within the heart of lochuir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain had seen so many of such occurrences leading to unstoppable explosions in his previous life.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in the new dome-towns of the nuclear-wasted areas.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in the solitary coffin-like space colonies on the asteroid belts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there would be violent riots every few days.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " many gangs would sprout out in the destitute overpopulated settlements like mushrooms after a rain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " public order would have declined to non-existence and diseases would spread like crazy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but when elrhain had asked his mother of the current worsening situation in an unplanned moment of vexation she beamed a smile so bright it washed away all his gloom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the fair maiden spun him around in the air praising how little rhain is already thinking like a proper chieftain!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned was a servant and now she is a noble.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so she could fairly represent both sides to certain extents.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and she did so after placing the pouty elrhain on her lap and stroking his hair tenderly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for the first time ever she sang what she thought life in the clan meant to her hidden opinions she had never spoken before much to the boys surprise.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nobles were strong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but to them there could never be enough strength.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the freemen wanted more than freedom they wanted land and people they could call their own.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally the servants either wanted to quietly live a life without hunger or suffering leaving all the complex thinking to the nobles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or they wished to cast away their bound sigils and live the life of the upper class they so envied.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " especially the ambitious ones.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and it only took one instance of success to plant the seed of ambition in even the most apathetic dhionne farmhand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with time more people would triumph in their respective goals.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these examples would tell the meek and the unambitious that even they the traditional losers of the realm can succeed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as for those who failed?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what proof would they leave behind if they were but bones in the dirt now?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were weak and had overestimated their puny abilities.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they should never have attempted to cross the cavern when they didnt have feet to walk.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but we arent like them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we are like the successful ones.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the newest freeman is even my cousin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " our mothers are sisters and our feet could not be more similar.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if he can do it so can i!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they would chant day and night.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to convince themselves to trick themselves to empower themselves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ultimately some more would succeed and so on till it became the norm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nobles the freemen and the servants would forget all their short term worries and be beholden to elrhain and agwyn for the long term glory their ritual had so generously bestowed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or so eluned exclaimed with shaking fists and zealous red eyes her slit pupils burning with the rage of dragons.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his mother had been acting strange lately.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain still weighed her views against his though.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " indeed a quick dispatch of an oceanic realmer would deal with all dissidents.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dhionne were much hardier than humans against diseases too or curses as they were called here.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unexpected illnesses were rare and epidemics were often caused because of malicious magical reasons more often than not.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their tribal lifestyle dietary habits and cultivation of manna gave them better immunity against things that would be fatal for a human and clan practices dictated a somewhat more hygienic lifestyle at least compared to the tribal folks back on ancient earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " another of the discrepancies elrhain had noticed from what should be expected in such societies designated pits all over lochuir to be used as outhouses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the only ones vulnerable enough to fatal ailments were the children and the elderly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to the dhionne fate was to be blamed for that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in the end the benefits would eclipse the losses a hundredfold.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but whatever reasoning elrhain could make in his head favouring the positives his modern values couldnt wholly ignore the negatives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " people would still die.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unique people with hopes and dreams just like him and he could not simply chalk them off as numbers on a sheet of paper.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the ways of this world were too unfamiliar obscure and exotic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he needed more information lest his worries never abated.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and he knew he wasnt the only one having such foreboding thoughts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " daddy also said something worrisome yesterday.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn muttered a hint of distress in her voice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lochuir might not be able to feed everyone who comes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " grandpas hair yellowed even more and daddy looked so haggard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ive never seen them so stressed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her unclenched palms gestured towards an area by aenraad river ranging from the tail end to the midsection of the line of dhionne.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " another prick in his mind and elrhains vision focused like a telescope.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dhionne there were unloading what seemed to be large leafy sacks and makeshift wooden containers full of sun and wind-dried foodstuff meats veggies and fruits.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they all had desaturated brownish colours with none of the vibrancy or freshness remaining.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the sheer quantity was enormous.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were at least a few thousand tons there and this was just the amount the dhionne convoys had brought in today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " which made what agwyn shared all the more unbelievable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " arent the manna-rioghs like fantasy dungeons seemingly able to spawn monsters out of nothing?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the production of gheists will soon go into overdrive right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no matter how many dhionnes come the clan should have enough catch to last years if not decades just from the usual hunting.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if lets say each mortal eats about 2 to 4 tons of food a year not even counting the cultivators.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ellie gheist meat is poison.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain started.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " seriously?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how did i not know that?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i didnt until yesterday either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i always took for granted how much meat we could eat every day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but in reality our daily dinner and the feast on the night of the ritual too are all luxuries only the highest noble houses can afford.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn twirled a lock of her leafy hair with a melancholic expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " apparently most dhionne live on wild fruits and vegetables and the meat of mortal or low earth level gheists.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since the lower cultivation keeps the toxins in their bodies down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but now their cultivation will quickly rise because of the overflow of manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " resulting in the number of safe to eat gheists dwindling alongside.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the scent of roasted meat once again brushed elrhains nose.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the sight of many tired dhionne carefully preparing a diminishing supply of foodstuff and still happily sharing that portion by portion with their family gave rise to a totally different feeling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even high realmers cant casually eat gheist meat for long.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for gheists above low earth only a few specific species of exceedingly less population are not poisonous.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " general gheists only have a small portion of their meat with low enough toxins to be viable as food.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you know which part that is?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded remembering all the times he had grumbled during their family suppers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the variety of meat was always a lot.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but at the same time it was so bloody lean.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whether fish or bird red or white not one satisfying fatty piece.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if anything other than a sirloin or chicken breast was taboo.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the adults reactions to his insensitive grumbling on the topic now made a lot more sense.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " imagine spending days on a hunt but you have to throw away ninety to ninety-five percent of the meat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " neither the quantity nor quality is anywhere near enough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was fine when the hunting areas spanned the whole siorrakty but now yikes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " exactly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could only click his tongue.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " why do kids have to be so aggravating?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " you want insults?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i was moulded in playground pettiness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain tapped the taller vesiphiss wings while apologizing to all adult sensibilities hed still retained before switching his psyche to the worst small-minded vindictive part of himself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his brain went overdrive thinking what would piss off a swaggering snub-nose with more pride than was healthy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then he remembered all the ancient period drama re-enactments hed binge-watched while he was lazing away and a downright vulgar grin covered his face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course he changed back just as quick.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " fark logic and to hell with reasoning.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " politeness was long thrown out of the window and only hot sauce remained flowing in his bloodstreams.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " is he always this rude?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis sighed shaking his head.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " so you were eavesdropping on our conversation?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the disgust on his voice leaked out so much that even vesiphis started backing off.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a murky gross kind of disgust.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not like sonoras or cadfael's but like when one stepped on dog crap or accidentally saw a snot-nosed kid's gross snot-nosed picture while scrolling down social media.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it hurt peoples souls not minds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis whispered with no small amount of shivers in his voice thats what you get mad at?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael didnt actually change his expression much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only the hint of incredulity swept past his eyes.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " so creep.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he spat spittle flying in every direction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the gusts of wind around them seemingly stilled in their own shock.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the children's laughter muted into the backdrop as that word hung in the air echoing time and time again until finally it hit the two others like sledgehammers.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he gasped and covered his mouth with his hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfaels face on the other hand finally showed a concrete reaction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its stone exterior broke down bit by bit and the ever-swaying shadows under him crackled like thunder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked absolutely scandalized.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boys faced blushed violet his upturned chin finally lowered with a visible electric shiver going through his body.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just when elrhain thought he would burst like a ripe tomato cadfaels enraged visage eerily morphed back into a deadpan poker face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it reminded elrhain of one of those videos where a buddhas face would change into an asuras but in reverse.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " honestly he was a bit spooked right now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe he had misjudged cadfaels humiliation tolerance?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thud the enraged boy in question took a step forward and the dust rose from the stone floor staying in the air as if gravity was just a suggestion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his eyes went from black to red then pink and finally lilac.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shadows rose up from the ground spewing swordlike tendrils while his hand reached for the actual sword behind about to unsheathe it- when a sudden pfft barged into the heated confrontation followed by a continuous bell-like giggle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn the voice behind the cute fit was literally laughing down on the ground twenty paces behind him punching the stone floor repeatedly with one hand and trying to cover her mouth with the other.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain heard cadfael snort with the swishing sound of shadows also retreating.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he sighed in relief but his sceptical mind picked something strange in that snort.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it sounded shy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he shook his head to get rid of the ridiculous thought.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by now the other children had also noticed agwyns bizarre behaviour and gathered around to see what was so fun.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the sounds returned and the wind began to flow again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain dusted agwyns fancy frock as she stood up her face still cramping from time to time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i didnt think it was that funny though?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but his face was sooo weird.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it reminded me of those times when miramarja opened the fridge all excited only to find her pudding gone!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i was hungry okay?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain averted his gaze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn puffed up her cheeks trying hard not to laugh forget it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whyd you rile him up so much?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you know the only thing you can beat in a fight in this hall is the food thats being roasted right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain snickered you think im dumb?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i would have screamed murder if he went any further.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and vesiphis was about to step in too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " besides the adults are only two minutes walk away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont believe those cultivators wouldnt hear all the magical sound effects from this close or let us youngns handle the matter ourselves when it comes to violence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then rubbed his throat and mimed crying for help.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eh i guess so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn twirled a lock of her hair infighting in the clan has always been limited to words unless its mommy auntie lilian or grandpa whos involved.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain involuntarily smiled at that remembering elder sonoras black and blue face when he was fleeing the courtyard the other day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn abruptly brought her eyes closer to his face almost giving him a heart attack.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she asked with a malicious squint do you think auntie lilian will beat that jerk up too if i go cry to her about how he bullied my ewwie?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont bother.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its our loss if they think youre a bratty princessthough your father might actually like that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it might piss off the other adults and give the kids a wrong impression even if cadfael gets the living daylight beaten out of him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " speaking of whom the brooding boy seemed to have regained his edgy bearing at the sight of agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he approached the two with a kind of purpose as they whispered sweet nothings to each other.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " most of the other kids watched on curiously while vesiphiss eyes clouded over with another nervous twitch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the eldest really was having a tough day today one shenanigan after the other.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to mention cati and ysbail hanging from his wings right now screaming some cryptic song about mud fights.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " olwina and ariana who were the next eldest after cadfael nodded to each other before blocking the goths path.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they also noticed something was wrong with the boy not to mention his earlier outburst which definitely didnt go unseen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but agwyn pushed them both aside and confronted the shadowy menace herself her chubby arms crossed before her puffed up chest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had just taken a deep breath about to unleash a machine gun of lisping slurring expletives when cadfael kneeled down on one knee like a medieval knight to absolutely everyones surprise.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he placed the now unsheathed sword horizontally on the ground gripping it with his right hand exclaiming cadfael morys earthloch greets the divine inheritor of our great clan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uh-oh elrhain whispered to agwyn through the link realization painting his voice i know why this guy is so pissed at me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn gulped shaking her head in denial.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " p-perhaps he is just dramatic because he didnt introduce himself with the others earlier?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael crushed her hope with his following words.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the saviour of mine faith and purpose you have given hope of salvation to me and all mine clans subjects by the great tide of fortune you have summoned forth from the ungenerous heavens.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then raised the sword up high holding the pommel at his forehead while the tip pointed at the sohwl above the sharp bone edge glinted in the midday suns like solid light.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " accept mine pledge of gratitude for ever if i cannot repay you today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i vow to cut down all foes remove all parasites and forge a path beyond the circles to protect yours honour with the spirits acknowledged if mine wish is to be granted in the unsettled future and the collapse hath been conquered!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with that he snapped down the pommel to his heart as a blood-red streak was left behind on his forehead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boys eyes now looked straight at agwyns.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his gaze serene and his blood-dripped face calm as if what he had just said was but another utterance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but his hands oh his hands gripping the sword trembled like a rickety wooden tower during an earthquake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few seconds of painful silence followed which the other kids then shattered hysterically in their shocked howls except cati and ysbail who just looked confused.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphiss mouth on the other hand was so wide that he didnt even notice the insect that flew in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the others didnt notice either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " neither did they notice the tips of cadfaels ears blushing an intense red or the heated possessiveness in his sizzling gaze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they didnt notice agwyns face turn a million degrees colder with every word of cadfaels or her tiny fingers twitching like they wanted to strangle something to death.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but elrhain did.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and in the advent of what could only be a love rival trying the steal the cooked rice from his mouth he laughed with absolute levity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " haiya i wish this world had popcorn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 30 - price the prideful dont pay\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn's voice came out with a sharp thorny yowl like a kitten with its tail walked on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she took a step back making not even an ounce of effort to hide her disgust.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael snapped his head up with eyes flashing in disbelief.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my heiress- he tried to frantically speak but a loud shout interrupted him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you shameless curr!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was vesiphis.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the winged boy pointed his fingers at the kneeling cadfael his hands shaking madly and face twisted into a rage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you-you-you are out of your mind!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he kept stuttering as if he could not find the right words.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that did not pose a problem in conveying his very real very negative emotions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain whistled watching the drama thicken.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his eyes met agwyn's who had also lost her earlier composer despite her resolute front just now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she looked at him unsure and afraid.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain winked at her giving her the solace she so needed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl huffed in relief scampering back to his side and hugging his arms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in the meantime vesiphis condemnation of cadfael had come to a full-blown argument.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this has nothing to do with you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael slowly enunciated his posture stoic and his white sword now pointed downwards.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you know what the pledge of red fate means?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you dare to even attempt a mimicry of it now of all places a month after the heiresss betrothal?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis didnt back down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " large claws started growing from his fingertips while the tattoos on his wings darkened.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he struggled to take in a breath as he yelled do you realize what uncle morys will think what the chieftain and grand elder will think?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am no whelp like you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am qualified to make my own decisions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis laughed but everyone could tell it wasnt out of good humour.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other kids retreated freeing up a circle for the two obvious hostile sides.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain even saw olwina and ariana share a strained look before remaining in front of the other kids as shields.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are they gonna do it?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this would be the first actual fantasy fight hed witness if that were to be the case.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i was mistaken about you cousin cadfael.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i simply assumed you were too fixated on training manna and that's why you found us indolent cousins too beneath you to spend your time with.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i could accept that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after all a life of cultivation is admirable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis spat on the ground his wings spreading wide but you're just a manner-less fool letting your supreme talent get to your head!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael unexpectedly nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so you do know i am a supreme.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then you should know my reasons cousin vesiphis.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or why else would she and i be born into the same era?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the spirits had called forth this fate for us and i witnessed my future with her during the blessed night!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the only person worthy of my heiress in the clan is me and the only person who is qualified to judge me is her the shadows under his feet swayed threateningly their dance rising in tempo with his every word.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not you not the adults and clearly not the clan which is forcing my heiress to be with that talentless waste.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael smiled warmly like a summer orchid in bloom as he gazed at agwyn not at all out of place on his otherwise impassive face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then his eyes turned bloodshot when he saw agwyn clutching elrhain's sleeves while rubbing her tiny face on his cheek.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the girl wasnt even looking at him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain on the other hand stared him dead in the eyes while stroking agwyn's leafy hair.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you think he will break his fa\u00e7ade again if i sniff your hair?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why dont we just kiss?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no way your breath stinks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then invent toothpaste!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain moved his head away from agwyns upturned lips before lightly slapping her mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as he yelled in pain with his hand bitten by the evil chipmunk he noticed something.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " something refreshing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with all the headaches these other earthloch kids including cadfael had brought along he had no chance to ruminate about the nightmares that haunted him every waking moment the last few weeks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if it was two days ago he would have been drawing up sophisticated plans and workarounds about everything or be worrying about things that hardly mattered at this point in time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet now he felt invigorated and satisfied as if an enormous weight had been taken off his shoulders.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it reminded him of the feeling he experienced when he had just finished an epoch-shattering toxic fight with strangers online.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " actually this might not be so bad.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain subconsciously said through the link.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " !agwyn recoiled her teeth bared.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " meeting people even if theyre kids.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain said his hands pinching her cheeks to keep her from biting him againall this time the only people we could truly be honest with were ourselves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even with our family we had to put on fa\u00e7ades and be wary of what we say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with these numskulls we can relax a bit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont think they are as stupid as you think.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they all look like fluffy kindergarten buns but act totally edgy like eighth graders.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn noddedbut i get your point.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she suddenly widened her eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is that why you have been acting peculiar lately?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no i havent!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont know what youre talking about.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i see now!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn clapped her hands the repeated stuffy confinements first in that room in the siaglas courtyard then in this earthloch courtyard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just when we thought we could go out more we were again stuffed inside rooms like sacks of potatoes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uh yup.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is the case just boredom i guess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if our bodies can get used to such long periods of passivity to our human minds it has already been thirty-hell-be-damned-long earth years.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn loosened her shoulders as if she could already feel the inertia flying away its no wonder youve been having nightmares and talking about how the world will eat you alive in your sleep in dramatic voices!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain choked on his breath no that is a wrong deduction you amateur sleuth!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn grinned now that you realize its okay to socialize how about sharing all those bottled up stinky worries with me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i bet even our family will listen if you just speak especially grandpa.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats not it i tell you!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but agwyn would have none of it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she kept rubbing her face on his even harder whispering to him why silence bred devils like the devil herself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis who saw their overly intimate lovey-dovey behaviour from the other side of a stunned cadfael laughed out loud in vindication well too bad for you our heiress refuses your worthless pledge faster than a racadger eats its cubs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if looks could kill then the glare cadfael shot would have murdered vesiphis ten times over and elrhain would have died a thousand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally throwing away the last semblance of politeness vesiphis raised a corner of his lips you mocked lord elrhain like mother like son?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i could say the same thing about you shameless horuxi primitive who respects not our traditions!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the second he finished shouting what elrhain could only guess was an ethnic slur the shadows under cadfaels feet shot out like torpedoes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shwoosh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis didnt even try to dodge using his giant wings to block the blows.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the wind carried with it the resulting shock wave as a cloud of dust exploded up alongside torn stalks of grass flowers and leaves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " kya!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cati and ysbail cried out hugging each other like lost lambs in a hurricane while the other kids dropped their relaxed attitude just as fast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only when they saw vesiphis unscathed did they sigh in relief.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the markings on vesiphiss wings glowed crimson the dust and sand gathering into numerous spear-like torrents in front of his outstretched clawed palms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he flew into the sky dodging all of cadfaels attacks then rained down the spears from above like a harbinger of justice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time it was the shadows that acted as a shield to protect cadfael from the counter barrage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it gave enough time for vesiphis to gather a river of conjured sand into one massive golden trident.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " repent your actions in the healers hut!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the winged boy screamed as the spear came crashing down like a meteorite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael snorted replying with a weakling!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as his shadows too morphed into a giant sword of darkness along the tip of his bone blade.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the two forces one slashing and one piercing clashed like thunder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " booom!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " another huge shockwave exploded out only the two shouts coming from the center of the impact making it past.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain tilted his head in confusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had been wide jawed at this magic battle until then amazed at what kids not even in the earthen realm could do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this level of destructive prowess then what about oceanic?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " could the birdbrained slug woman really be that powerful?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then he heard vesiphis and cadfaels loud voices echo out from the dust screen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " those shouts sounded more likeyelps?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain had devoured too many bowls of delicacies to count as if he had fasted for months savouring each bite and sip of this sumptuous feast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he couldnt help it it tasted way too good!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " even sugar was nowhere to be seen with crude salt and some wastefully dried herbs being the most used condiment.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the fruits aged pulped or fresh were also an explosion of sweet sour bitter or all of them combined.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " while he was confident that he could make these already delicious dishes figuratively reach the heavens with the right spices he had learnt to let go of what could not be and focused on what is.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " i do not wish to see disharmony in our house not with the collapse right around the corner.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you blame yourself for disharmony that cadfael wrought?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .it was not his fault alone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and as the eldest i have an obligation to lead by example.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " perhaps you do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and when cadfael did something obviously ill-advised backed by his selfish desires you decided to stop him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i think your actions were exemplary enough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis didnt look convinced yet i don't think he will change his ways.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " father had warned me about characters like him who are so common in the impelakty i didnt expect my own house would have one as well.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if he takes drastic measures now with the disregard he already has for the clan?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy scratched his wings the white fluff on the tips seemed far greyer than before.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could also detect slight cracks on the membranes which slowly mended as vesiphiss fingers traced over them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if i can't help him revise his willful ways then what's the point?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain thought on that question for a while munching on a root vegetable of some kind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the earthy taste was reminiscent of the woodland taro back home.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was refreshing in a way that cleared up his mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis peered at him with expectant eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it really hammered in the fact the winged boy was still that a boy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a child who could hardly see the intricacies of the world no matter how maturely he spoke.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he asked difficult questions with difficult answers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and just like any other kid he needed guidance when encountering a situation like this when reality smacked him right on the face blowing away his ideals of the world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though for some reason he sought this guidance from elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe it was because vesiphis was just hyper curious like children tend to be or perhaps because there were no actual adults around or it could be that elrhain gave off a more adult-like feeling than he realized.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was sure that the vesiphis as a child would forget this dilemma in the face of more exciting things he would see tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but what if he didnt?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so elrhain wanted to give him a proper answer whatever that might be.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " let me ask you this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you believe what you did was absolutely useless?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he carefully asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis looked frustrated for a second but then nodded uncertainly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the only thing my actions did was aggravate the conflict further.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael maintained his stand that only he was worthy of the heiresss hand to the very end despite my intervention.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or even uncle morys.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i disagree.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you accomplished many things with your actions today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " many things that actually matter to the clan right now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain smiled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " firstly you protected annie and me from a bully proving your courage and sense of duty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " secondly you showed to our house that you are willing to oppose even a supreme talent a relative no less in the name of the justice you believe in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at the very least you earned mine and annie's trust with that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only the blind would not see your integrity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain stopped and took a bite out of the giant boiled snail agwyn held to his mouth imitating how the five girls were feeding vesiphis.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he closed his eyes to chew for a few moments to fully savour the taste and formulate his thoughts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " 'like lemon chicken.'\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when he opened them again all the others too were attentively staring at him waiting for what he had to say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " indeed the circumstances had made each of them more intelligent than their earth counterparts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain couldnt help but smile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally you showed us that you are compassionate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even now you feel sorrow for the very culprit who chipped your wings and cut your hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " many would call that a weakness but to me it is one of the most important qualities that make a true leader.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you feel sorrow because you care.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some would simply handwave this matter away after the dust had settled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as he finished speaking a silence stretched out waiting for someone to break it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis looked down at his injured fingers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then clenching and loosening his fists he voiced the same question as he did at the start i thank you for your praise my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but what of cousin cadfaels current position?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what kind of leader am i if i had to antagonize a blood relative to prove all that?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i did not mean to marginalize him with my actions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why couldnt he just... calm down and think.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that way he wouldnt be punished as such.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain and agwyn flinched at those familiar words.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they exchanged a wistful gaze but laughed nonetheless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dhionnes are just humans with magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn whispered and elrhain agreed despite this very fact being one of his fears in the nightmares.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dhionnes humans.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they puzzle over the same things go through the same emotions and commit the same mistakes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the question you ask is one that has no clear answer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what is the meaning of life?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why do wrongdoers commit evil?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why should we fight for survival in the collapse when it is much easier to just give up?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why is cadfael the way he is right now?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the crisp wind and summer sun felt slightly scorched on his skin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it helped him keep his point of view grounded to set up a response that agreed with his own selfish morality.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to see the clans future not in conflict with his own.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because elrhain knew that his following words would possibly define vesiphis and all the other kids' lives from now on to a tangible extent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would be a lie to say he didnt find the situation both heavy and amusing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was hoodwinking them in a sense.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because of choice my winged compatriot.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there are other factors sure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but people ultimately are who they choose to be.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " 'like how i was a lazy unlovable coward in my last life.'\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain shook those thoughts away and continued sigils can deter a slave from the choice of what they do through pain and violence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the most profound thoughts in their hearts will always be their own.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because the freedom of thought and what they do with it is the absolute scale on which to judge a person in my humble opinion of course.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there will be a point in an individuals life where a single choice will define them for the rest of their lives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a truth or die moment which will influence every future decision they make slaves and nobles alike.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that elrhain pointed at the place where cadfael and vesiphis fought is who cadfael is right now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his audience looked puzzled perhaps not understanding the deeper nuance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain sighed and sorted out his words i am not talking about status situation cultivation knowledge or the many other things that you think may define you that you think you have little to no control over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet those are all either external factors only fate can dictate or animalistic urges you cannot ever command.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he thumped his chest with his tiny fist not caring for the grease that smeared his robe.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what i am talking about is internal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the most fundamental part of your character that nothing but your own conscious choices your morality can shape.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not the murder of your family and not even unlimited riches.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " call it your superego.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the midpoint between your character moulded by external situations your ego and the bestial desires etched deep into your flesh that is too unpredictable to trust your instincts shall we say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain saw a hint of realization dawn upon a few of those glossy optimistic eyes and beamed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these kids truly were bright seedlings that can be taught.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well except for cati and ysbail who looked as confused as a bird in water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so with a nod of a teacher elrhain said cadfaels superego and morality built by no one other than himself will not change because of a few words from you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just as your choice to block his path was not prevented by his apparent superior talent or his claims that might sound logical to many people of our siorrakty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " many say that you are what your environment makes you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but for me who has not seen many truths of the world in person have not suffered the vastitude of fates cruel mechanisms i can say that we as nobles are privileged.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we have far better handle on our own destiny and our own choices than that of servants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the same is true for you and cadfael and everyone else present here.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we are what we let the environment make of us!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is what i believe in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what matters now elrhain paused.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he gave their brains a slight respite to further take in the advice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the anticipation would help them remember what they were feeling in this moment for cycles to come is what choice you make.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to you you failed because you couldnt change cadfaels mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but have you already etched that conclusion to your soul?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " will you let it define your future choices?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i sure hope not.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because like i said to me your accomplishments today far outweigh your measly losses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so what will you do?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " will you succumb to the failure which you so readily admitted wallowing in the possibilities of what could have been?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or will you remember the pain of this one failure within your many successes learn from it and continue to grow into a leader that can find victory even within the bleakest of defeats?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the choice my friend is yours.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with that said elrhain pointed his upturned palm towards the winged boy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis took a long few minutes to comprehend elrhains words.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he mumbled in confusion with a distracted look on his face while the others around the table peeked at him with nervous expressions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally when elrhain was just about to start sweating in embarrassment vesiphis stood up with a jolt my lord!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i have been presumptuous.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how could i dare claim to be a leader when we have both the heir and heiress?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with the wisdom you have just- elrhain slammed the table hard in anger agwyn facepalming beside him with a giggle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he pointed at vesiphis with spittle flying out of his mouth you numbskull!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you five sisters hold this fool down and make him drink that pot full of honeyrot pulp to clear his demented brain!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his fingers swished in the wind marking a large jar harrowing with ominous bubbling concoction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little ladies saluted ignoring vesiphiss struggles as they forced him to chug two litres worth of edible retribution.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " siani even brought out a second smaller jar that stank like wet socks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the deed finished and vesiphis now purple in the face elrhain asked you done with the jokes?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other boy burped while he glared at the five girls in indignation maybe also indigestion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my lord i truly wasnt joking!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i have understood what you taught me and will always remember it by heart.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and that is but another proof of the fact that no one else but you are worthy of tackling such complex subjects despite your age.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your charisma makes us listen to your words which i sorely lacked when i stopped cadfaels foolishness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain groaned finding it excruciating to deal with vesiphiss thought process first you brood on a problem till your face turned blue.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now that your face is purple you immediately skipped over an issue the moment you identified it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you vesiphis managed to blush even with his nauseous expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " forget it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " look.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " first of all if you think i am some charismatic leader that can change peoples mind with a few words you are woefully mistaken.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " id be a mind-controlling naeman witch then not a leader.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i can only advise the choice to change is others.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and second he reached over the log table and slapped vesiphiss pudgy cheeks a few times if you dont have confidence in your charisma then simply become a different type of leader.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a type that needs little.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or even none.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a different type?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not all leaders have to make blood boiling speeches or lead a charge at the front into enemy lines.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each major quality defines a particular kind of leader and a great leader simply commands many of them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some lead by the force of their overwhelming cultivation some by their heart-chilled cunning and some by their mesmerizing beauty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they each lack the type of charisma you hope for.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but they all have a different type of charisma only their followers and enemies can see.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one of which i am certain you too possess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " r-really?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis tried to stand up but had trouble balancing himself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his stomach rumbled hard but strangely his visage turned healthier after that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded from what i have seen the kids listen to you not because you have a magnetic charm but because of your very effective nagging.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its true.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i saw how you broke up fights and that time you stopped siani.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you nag and complain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and when that doesnt work you use the good old-fashioned fist and stick.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they listen to you because they trust that the only time you hound them like a deranged shrew is when they have done something wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they can see your goodwill through that veil of annoying scolding.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " aint that right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other kids glanced at each other in bewilderment for a few moments then burst into childish laughter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they nodded and hooted at the winged kid.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a heartwarming scene for elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but not for vesiphis!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait y-you guys.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is that really why youve been following me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked both incensed and dumbfounded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " siani shot back why?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you thought it was because of how heroic you are oh noble and courageous busyfish?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she paused for a bit then burst into a second round of fits and giggles with everyone else.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis deflated h-how could this be.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain couldnt stop the corners of his lips from curling cheer up bud.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hmm?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bwaaaaah!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis wallowed bursting into tears.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the winged boy wailed for a while longer as if his whole world had been a lie.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn and elrhain looked on awkwardly not knowing what to do while the other kids switched from teasing to try and cheer vesiphis up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then finally finding the last bit of courage the winged boy wiped the tears and snot away and asked t-then what kind of leader does the h-heir think i can be?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain huffed in relief seeing the pup regaining his bearing then smiled you my good friend are a manager.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a manager?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " a flier arrived in extreme urgency bearing word of a new group of arrivals.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the watch member mounted on the winged gheist dropped down on the other garden without so much as a proper greeting signifying the importance of the news.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few minutes later an urgent vissaged chieftain charged aunt meredith with the task of bringing back the children to their residential courtyards.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the heir and heiress would have none of it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after more time wasted from their incessant begging and crying the grand elder finally decided to bring them along citing how they would have to get used to it sooner or later.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course vesiphis himself would be going accompanying his father.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so would olwina and ariana.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was their duty as the eldest three of the present cousins excluding cadfael who was second to take the helm of clan matters before all else.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " just a few ten-minutes ago it was vesiphis who could not stop wailing at that soul-shattering revelation by the heir.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the tiny boy had vomited out all the food from the feast at the sight of blood and gore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i suppose he is still a babe.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis found the dichotomy oddly acceptable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the heir elrhain was so curiously composed while articulating about complex matters as he did earlier that he gave the illusion of a sage in a boys body.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the heirs wisdom was eye-opening.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if it had dragged vesiphis out from a swamp of murky deception to a world of clarity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the same elrhain could not stand the sight of blood a sight which would only become increasingly common in the coming future.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis remembered the first time he had witnessed such.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a hunter had his legs mutilated by a panena a mushroom-like gheist adept in stealth and deceit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was 5 cycles old then and had actually passed out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so a babe or not the two clan heirs were certainly handling this experience better than he had.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wise vesiphis muttered under his breath but inexperienced as he should be.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who is?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his father cadwell endcloud earthloch asked from beside him with bewildered eyes noticing that vesiphis had streaks of water on his face.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " so embarrassing!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis could not help his face from heating up which bewildered his father even more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the chieftains aid was overseeing the site of the impromptu healers' huts as one injured dhionne after another was carried in.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the mammoth of a man now watched on listless his injured left arm bounded to his body with medicinal wraps.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could not save twenty-seven of his people mostly elderly but five children too under ten cycles and three young men.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the heir had caught one of the surviving children staring at her deceased fathers body with dull eyes and had completely lost his bearing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the same child was whom vesiphis observed right now standing beside her mourning mother.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " his reaction means he cares and i am confident that he will be the one to lead our whole siorrakty through the collapse to clinch victory.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his father whistled in good humour such high praise my son.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since when do you think about things so deeply?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis blushed scratching his head im just repeating what the heir himself told me a few hours ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is that so young cadwell?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a gruff voice suddenly spoke out from behind and vesiphis turned around in a hurry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had recognized the speaker and bowed to show his reverence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the grand elder stood there with the chieftain and the grand shamanka herself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all three supreme leaders had come to see the injured.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they would presumably also examine each of the deceased with their own eyes as always.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because some decisions they simply could not make without understanding the consequences of the collapse themselves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " g-grand elder- thundham interrupted him by waving a hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old man smiled pray tell what that fish-gremlin grandson of mine put into your head?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no doubt our grand shamanka here would also be interested.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the much younger-looking yet two full heads taller woman nodded in eagerness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis stood in the presence of the three most authoritative clan figures and gulped weighing if that conversation was something he should keep secret.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he judged no since all the other younglings had also been there to bathe in the heirs wisdom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he cleared his throat and straightened his back doing his best to re-convey what had been spoken during the feast as faithfully as he could.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at the very end of his narrative he finished up with his own comments on the matter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " g-grand shamanka if i may be so bold to offend what lord elrhain told me made so much more sense than what the storytellers speak of about similar subjects during our monthly sermons.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they only praise the spirits or the disc and blame any inner turmoil a dhionne can face upon fate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the heir explained cousin cadfaels and all dhionnesumm mentality so precisely with examples i could see with my eyes or hear with my ears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like the runes of an array formation by a mage in contrast to the runes of a ritual of the shamans and witches.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " until now all i have heard over and over again could not even compare with the few words from the heir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " honestly if i had only been taught as such from a younger age i could have handled todays matter to a better conclusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " certainly lilian nodded enthusiastically her demeanour more like a young shaman apprentice rather than an expert of high dignity ego instinct superego.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " such wondrous concepts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham did you teach such things to him?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no that cant be it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and i cannot imagine bromwyn or cyra doing that either much less his own parents.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham looked laughably offended at that while the chief actually laughed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how peculiar indeed!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " did he gather all that from the meagre dhionne interactions he observed in the past cycles?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or is there more?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian muttered her fingers that gripped the staff tapped against its surface.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she then turned towards vesiphis again as the same staff lightly bonked on his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her eyes curved into crescents seemingly finding amusement in vesiphiss reaction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the playful chiding was by no means painful.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but vesiphis still squinted his eyes shuffling uncomfortably in place.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian laughed whatever may be the case you should keep those words in your heart.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since you are still young.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you have all the time in the world to learn and cultivate yourself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do not lament like an old geezer when you are not even ten.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that should be our job!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilians following words cheered him up follow your father and learn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no matter how much the heir can spell out the ways of the world from his feathered bed in a closed and guarded room he will nevertheless need companions to guide him through the hurdles of the real world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when that time comes i am sure your role in his journey will be just as significant as his role in yours right now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " understood?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " y-yes grand shamanka!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis stuttered out an excited reply with his fists clenched tight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this had probably been the best day of his life to be praised as such by the grand shamanka herself!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the motivation to strive for better was brimming within his tiny soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now go!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " see how your other two cousins are helping out and tending to the injured?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i expected you to take the lead as the eldest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am on it your holiness!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " saying that he rushed off towards olwina and ariana.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the former used her bloodlines mortal totem to help the healers remove poison from an elderly woman while the latter acted as her helper with her mastery of lesser water spells.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis didnt know exactly how he could be of assistance with his sand aspected manifestation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he knew all he had to do was ask one of the healers or watches and they would show him the proper steps.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that was enough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like the grand shamanka had said he still had time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and he would make excellent use of that time and his current optimism.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when the heir had grown up when vesiphis himself too gained enough experience to be a good manager he would be ready by elrhains side.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he would absolutely not let olwina ariana or anyone else get a head start on that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " exactly like you cadwell thundham said to the winged man as cadwells son sprinted away in newfound inspiration.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though i still question exactly what you saw in my stone-headed son the first time you met him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " me too my lord me too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadwell watched his son fondly though if what my son recounted is true he will be in better hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham and even bromwyn who stood to the side guffawed at the statement.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " true indeed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if only the other houses could have the eyes to see.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " especially our grand shamankas prideful nephew ey?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian groaned can you stop bringing that up?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ive already beaten the spirits out of him twice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what more do you want?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " haha my apologies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i speak with no offence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and as long as cousin bevin doesnt try to sell his grandson to me anymore i am sure he will mean no offence either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham replied not at all deterred by lilians scowl.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his aged eyes kept watching his people come and go their plight and their resilience.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as long as we can tread past this initial stage all will be well.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all should have been well but.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because he didnt only see what was in front.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he also saw the future and similar problems cropping up one after the other.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his eyes flickered only lilian catching a glimpse of the flashing emotion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was precisely why she didnt berate thundham for incessantly bringing up bevin earthloch sonora.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because she too could see the disharmony her nephews blind zeal for forcing his own ideals could bring about and what it would mean for the clan's unity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as it was food shelter safety and a good nights sleep everything was already a luxury.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they needed solutions not more internal problems.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and they needed those solutions fast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because in two cycles at most both the internal and external complications of the clan would reach a tipping point and ultimately everything would start losing cohesiveness.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " youll regret this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you know that right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you think youre the only hot shit on the market?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will see how many of those unrealistic utopian dreams you can pull off being so na\u00efve.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " theyll eat you alive this world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont trust myself enough to keep a reign on what a person with too much ambition will do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont trust people in general to keep their ambitions to themselves either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " better let the government handle all that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain woke up feeling refreshed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the voices of the past echoed in his ears in a vain attempt to pull him into the nightmares one last time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but his mind was too rejuvenated to pay them any heed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he blinked then blinked again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the moonlight bounced off his honey glazed skin the celestial bodies above playing hide and seek with the night clouds as their pearly light flickered dim and bright.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when he sat up he noticed the leafy bedding underneath his palms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " somebody had taken him back to their room and he didnt even know when he had fallen asleep.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his memories came back in gentle streams.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the emotions remained yet their intensity faded to a black and white as if he was reliving that moment as a spectator in a noir cinema.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dead dhionne being carried away for their untimely cremation the lifeless body of a young boy torn in half and the survivors looking on with their numb unfeeling gazes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl who could not cry even though her entire being screamed in anguish.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he cried in her stead in their stead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and now he sat more awake than ever.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked towards the girl sitting at the edge of the bed right by the window.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her serene gaze fixed on the many moons above.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the night was cold the wind bringing an icy calmness with it as it comfortably ruffled elrhains fuzzy hair.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " had it rained?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " from where he was the sky didnt look madden with angry cumulonimbi.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it had a certain luminous quality to it as if the stars had been magnified by windows of water and the starlight now scattered off surfaces in a much more vigorous manner.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the forest cacophony outside was crisper and every breath so fresh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so distant from the death and sorrow of the dhionne earlier.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain crawled too lazy to stand up and took a seat beside agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie its not our fault.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we didnt know some dumb ritual would cause a mass refugee cw-crisis.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no one told us.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were all cryptic and like listen to the ancestors guidance!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i agree elrhain said and agwyn turned towards him with an unconvinced look.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she scrutinized his face carefully before gently smiling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i thought you would still be blaming yourself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " making up how oh so unfortunate you are my dear self-deprecating gentle sir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i did enough of that in my head already so you are kind of right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a moment passed before both of them laughed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was weak had no humour and as agwyn put it self-deprecating.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie can i ask you something?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his uncharacteristic reservation made agwyns eyes quiver.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet she nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are you annie because you are agwyn?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the hesitation in elrhains magical voice was unmistakable for the nervous little girl or because you are annamaria hildebrand?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn averted her eyes but elrhain pushed on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " am i ellie because i am elrhain or alex fischer?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could see her tiny body tremble with every word.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but this was something he wanted no needed to know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would decide him an answer to a question all too important to ignore anymore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally after ten more minutes of silence or perhaps rumination agwyn opened her mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she said and elrhain sighed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but suddenly the girl started weeping repeating her answer out and without i dont know!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and within i dont know!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before he realized it elrhain found himself hugging her quivering shoulders.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a tight hug and whatever hesitation elrhain might have felt with himself the days prior vanished like puffs of smoke.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he stroked her leafy hair as gently as he could and agwyns sobbing turned into muffled wails.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt until eluned rushed into their room that agwyn regained a semblance of tranquillity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but even then she was unwilling to let go of him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally elrhains mother laid down beside the two in the bed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she hummed a lullaby her soft singing harmonizing with agwyns gentle breathing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for once elrhain felt guilt for making the two most important women in his new life upset.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eyes red and a strained smile agwyn piped after swallowing a boiled bone-marrow-like piece of meat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are you bullying me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain smirked what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you embarrassed that you had to be cuddled to sleep two days in a row-owe!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ouch!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stop that!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he tried to push away the hands pulling his hair and ear but the other party was too strong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rude.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally after cyra had pried off agwyns iron grip while picking up the flailing daughter he complained with a nasal tone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl just hmphed before shyly lowering her eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she started awkwardly twiddling with her fingers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " does it matter if i am annamaria or agwyn?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i still love- alright!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i get it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " geez annie you dont have to say such embarrassing things out loud.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he stopped we have earth common for a reason you know!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " e-ellie what if one day i forget how it is like to be the old me and completely become a different person?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i-im scared.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if this strange world turns us into people the past we would detest?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if you dont want to be with me anymore because i dont have a cute tail like siani or ysbail?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eh they do have cute tails.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain scratched his ear but then he shuddered sensing danger.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " put that plate down you violent hag!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dare you to throw that at me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i double dare you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lets see how you fare when i stop talking to you for a month straight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when agwyn reluctantly discarded her artillery elrhain nodded while huffing through his nose finally he stood up to the real bully.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he scoffed at the glaring little girl while chiding good.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now listen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and forget siani for discs sake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shes got a crush on my father not me!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain cleared his throat before he continued.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i pondered about this a lot the past few weeks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ultimately we are already different people than we used to be back then.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i came to the conclusion that one it is entirely useless to worry about this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i wont tell you to stop worrying just stop letting the worry take over your whole life.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because two the most shameless part of our humanity will ensure that while we do change it wont fundamentally alter the person we grew up to be for seven decades on earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you get me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn tilted her head in confusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " consider it like this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you told me the clan is more like a dictatorship.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i know you wanted me to recognize that no matter what farked up thing we do here the other noble houses cant do anything to hinder our betrothal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " regardless of my deficiencies regardless of there being more talented kids than me that they want to pimp.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because the three earthloch leaders and cyra a sky realmer will always be our ally.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " am i right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn nodded not minding cyra who was very un-sky-realmerly trying to shift her attention away from elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but our worries are rooted in this very fact.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if we get used to such privileges.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i can use absolute power to do a lot of good because dissidents dont really matter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unlike in the collective you or your mother here wont have to heed any other political factions standpoint.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we can force development education science and so many other things.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and at the end of the journey maybe a hundred or more cycles later who will we become at that point?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " will we become authoritarian leaders?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " leaders who will grow so used to our word being the mandate of god so numb to worldly struggles that we are essentially no different from evil dictators with messiah complexes?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if that happens we will have no restraint.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there will be no bottom line we wont cross because of the greater good.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe one day even our own opinions will clash.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont wanna!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn shook her head fiercely wanting to refute his point but elrhain held his index finger up.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " human history has proven that again and again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and even though our bodies are dhionne we are humans.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet then i realized i was overthinking!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and how that is such a wonderful thing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain beamed and agwyn looked even more bewildered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i read a lot of philosophy books right after i dissolved my company and that thing with naomi.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " never stop thinking they almost invariably say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i can use earthlochs unquestioned authority to forcefully bring about good.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but internally i can scream and complain and blame myself for days to come because as a modern human how dare i abuse such great power!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since most of the subjects of earthloch literally cannot complain my inner voice has to ever be the harshest critique.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wittgenstein nietzsche foucault and even marx said a controlled evaluation of one-self can be a whetstone for steadfast resolve.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " humans are hypocrites like that.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is a generally progressive direction even with cataclysmic human-made extinction events especially in the last three millennia after the common era had begun.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the hypocrisy of blatant self-blame forced us to iterate repeatedly until our selfish justifications for doing what we do best started reflecting reality our sheer shamelessness bringing a net positive change to the world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it may sound weird coming from me but the very fact i worry about what i will become will be the crux of keeping me both as elrhain and alex until the day i die again.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain patted his legs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont worry about it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thinking has never been your strong suit.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " what else is a 2-cycle old kid supposed to do other than eat sleep and poop?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you already said she cant cultivate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unlike servant children she doesnt have to help out with family matters at such a young age.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " like learning to read and write.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " huh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ysbail stopped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her eyes blinking rapidly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe get a learned servant to impart her how to recognize uorian symbols?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i bet by the time she is old enough to cultivate shed be smarter than siani.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " huh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyns eyes lit up.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " actually we should adopt this for when all babes are two cycles old in our main house!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ysbail broke down into tears again but for an entirely different reason.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alas what has been decided by a leader cannot be taken back by the tears of an adorable little girl alone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thus despite her flailing she was dragged down to the elders rest with the giddy cati while agwyn whispered to elrhain with an imperceptible grin you evil little bastard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you doomed them all.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " their second time entering the elders rest was much like the first.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the adults carried them down most of the journey and they didnt delve as deep this time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " about twenty minutes later they reached a large underground cavern with tranquil streams running down the ground.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the cascading waterfalls backdropping a large platform suspended in mid-air by chains at the centre of this space which was connected to many tunnels of the caverns walls with floating stone steps.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the platform was of blue crystals green algae and grey stones circular in nature and reaching about twenty meters high.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stairs covered in moss cracked and uneven yet evidently held together by magic connected the platform to the cavern floor below.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain had to stop himself from gawking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he spotted the other kids and heard cati squeal like an excited kitten while ysbail snorted with twice the cuteness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " most of the kids on the platform sat crossed legged.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each had a glowing circle underneath them which evidently helped with cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael was also there but he didnt notice the new arrivals thanks to what elrhain assumed was a deep meditation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few of the younger kids like siani and cadough rested to the side their faces breaking into giant smiles when they saw them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was also a dwarfish man elrhain had met at the gathering the month before who also sat cross-legged on a boulder at the very front of the cultivating kids with a stern glare in his eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when he saw elrhains group walk in he lazily waved a hand at them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn waved back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " five minutes later cati elrhain and agwyn were seated on top of their own glowing circle while cyn had to drag back ysbail at the foot of the stairs as she kept trying to run up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " without so much as a proper reception the man tudor arente earthloch as introduced by bromwyn officially started the threes first steps in cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " heiress he sighed you cannot share one manna gathering circle with the heir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there is not enough manna for the both of you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was the third time he had said that and agwyn bashfully giggled while sitting back down on her own circle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " good.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tudor smiled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now listen carefully to the words i say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " young cati please.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stop getting distracted by ysbail.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain really wanted to pat the guy on the back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was not easy trying to coerce overexcited kids to concentrate on one thing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if he were in tudors place he would have already committed the crime of spanking them into obedience.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the short man must have had a lot of experience seeing as he was the official clan tutor and all for the main house.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his temper was even and his face barely twitched at their antics.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " close your eyes tudor directed and elrhain complied.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " heiress and heir- you can call us gwyn and rhain!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes gwyn and rhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you remember the sensations you felt when you received the blessing from the spirits?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " kinda?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " kinda will be enough elrhain swore he could hear a note of amusement in tudors voice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the manna gathering circles underneath you yes the glowing circles they will send up similar particles of manna for your use.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course they will lack the ichor of the spirits or the quality so you will need to focus harder to feel them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the sensation will be quite similar to that time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " delve deeper when you grasp the manna and do not let your mind wander.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as for young cati your family should have already taught you how to feel the manna using your eyes right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no dont open them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time i want you to sense the manna without their assistance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was acquainted with meditation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was part of the school curriculum back on earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mindfulness was essential for daily practice alongside compassion spirituality and stillness at movement depending on the person.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could not do the latter while sitting cross-legged even if he somewhat wanted to try that right now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this felt a lot like guided meditation minus the magical props he was using.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but for now he simply followed tudors guidance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could experiment with mixing earth meditation with fantasy meditation later.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " totemic soul marrow core spirit totem and ichoric heart chamber.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ignore the latter three for today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because for the initiation to manna and the most important opening lesson i will teach you now depends solely on the first.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is your link to find harvest and cultivate manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your other self that lives in the astral realm as you do on the material disc.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for the first few minutes elrhain was lost.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he couldnt spot them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " neither manna nor this totemic soul thingy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the slow underground wind and sound of water the gentle breaths coming from his left and right and tudors gruff voice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could visualize each and every happening in the cavern his supernatural senses taking in information like a sponge his dhionne brain filtering through them like a computer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the orbs of manna were nowhere to be found.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he sat there minute after minute.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just when his mind was about to wander away for the nth time back to a novel he had once read he sensed something.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like spotting a clue from the corner of his eyes but more fleeting and with all his senses not just sight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he doubled down on the feeling but gently as to not scare it away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " soon the boredom and emptiness left his mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what replaced it was marvel and novelty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like fireworks in the darkness of his mind they appeared simultaneously.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one moment it was a black canvas the next he felt as if he was a god staring down at himself from the heavens above.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he saw teeny-tiny fireflies millions of them rising up from below his body and scattering into the void where his senses could not reach.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " blue green and brown red gold and purple.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they came in every hue and every shade of both visible and invisible light.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " always dancing always mixing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " manna he realized.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like the orbs gifted by the spirits but so much smaller so many more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and within the middle of that upward shower he saw an unmoving darkness in the shape of a tiny little dhionne.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it had a dim constellation of stars inside.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were different from the manna particles they felt empty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these stars sat static.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as he observed them a thought popped up in his mind or was it tudors voice?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could not tell.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if the manna comes from a source then might these be the sink?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet unlike the dancing vigorous manna these stars inside the toddler-shaped void were weak blinking and had a hollow core filled with thick toxic sludge.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " none of the manna entered that silhouette of darkness flowing around it as if it was a jutting rock lying in the way of a raging torrent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that darkness was his totemic soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 35 - nodes\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your goal in cultivation is to capture part of the world the natural manna that flows from the very disc to the void beyond and make it a part of your blood bones and soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tudors voice had a hypnotic twang to it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he did not speak too slow or too fast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not too loud or too quiet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was just perfect.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it guided elrhain as he tried to reach out a filament of his mind towards one of the thousands of particles of manna that drifted past in his inner vision.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however the manna refused his invitation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was repulsed afraid or shy even.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he failed and failed some more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but with every try his grasp crept closer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a part of the repulsion changed to attraction and some of the manna seemed to almost warm up to him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " every person has their own talent and no two are perfectly identical.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is the bloodline the spirits and for most it is a sort of unseen luck.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " us earthlochs for example excel in the ways of water whether it is actually using water or melding the concept of water into other manners of magic.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " they are the projection of your physical bodys apertures into the astral plane and vice versa.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain noticed that not all nodes were of the same hue saturation or value.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the vast majority were various shades of blue brown and green with some nasty fleshy red pink and violet nodes shining almost a translucent light mixed in here and there.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet there was never an utterly pure colour.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if you can notice the influence of natural elements within the latter such as winter ice or summer heat their make differs vastly from simple ice and fire magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " manna is complex like that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " aspects can also be spiritual divine demonic and so on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " perhaps one day after the collapse ends you will have the fortune to visit discs far outside our own.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you will witness unimaginably strange and varied uses of manna in magic unique to those foreign lands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it will make you suspect if manna should even be classified into aspects like we do here.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in some discs in fact they regard manna as nothing more than the food one eats to do magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for example on certain discs every dead object can grow a living spirit with its own particular aspect of magic which in our disc rarely happens.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but similar to this phenomenon the nodes within your totemic soul too can lead to never-before-seen magic if you pair it with never-before-seen combinations of manna cultivation method ichor and spirit totem.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not that i would advise you blindly do so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before utilising the manna the only real clue we have is their colour and a gut feeling that can come only with experience.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mind time demonic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain didnt know what colour these weird magic concepts straight out of a fantasy book would have but the closer he looked the more bizarre the colours of his own nodes got.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the brightest of the lot about sixty at a cursory glance numbering perhaps less than one-tenth of the total gave off mainly a water-logged impression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if he was wandering in the forest without shoes his bare feet dipped into the damp soilthe chirps of critters all around and a primal sense of belonging rising from deep within his chest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt uncomfortable just out of place.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the feeling wasnt of pure water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in elrhains magical senses they appeared like a combination of water with softwood and moist earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like a forest or a swamp maybe even a flooded lowland.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and that was only when he tried to feel the brightest of nodes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when he took in all of them one thousand nodes if tudor was to be believed together the feeling changed into something completely unknown.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " something he could not put his finger on at all even disregarding the slight headache.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the overall aspect was changing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the current untrained elrhain could not set it into a clear image.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " malleable never absolute with infinite permutations.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " depending on which order he concentrated on the nodes elrhain could make out forests oceans a little bonsai tree or even a broccoli breakfast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " every dhionne starts cultivation by first observing their totemic soul for long periods and capturing which path of aspects most suit them judging by the colours.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only then must he try to absorb ambient manna of roughly the same colour and feed them into the totemic soul depending on which nodes he wishes to ignite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this process also happens naturally from the moment of your birth as you eat and drink.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is why many mortals can ignite one two or even five hundred nodes by virtue of their environment alone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cultivation hastens that process many many folds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for the sake of learning we shall initiate you on that very task today guiding manna into a node.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " fret not i am here to protect you in case anything goes wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " also never try to feed fire manna to a node that favours water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " instead choose manna from nature that gives you the cold of snow the flow of lakes the calm of dew-drops and even the impression of an agile fish if you so wish.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " keep nature in harmony and your totemic soul will not splinter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to reach the earthen realm this step is crucial.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since a harmonious totemic soul is much easier to realign using an ichor.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i digress.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " let us return to the matter at hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the formation array under you will capture manna from all over the loch sagathan area for your use.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is something only the main house of earthloch can enjoy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so remember to always be grateful for our plentiful bounty to the ancestors to the spirits and most importantly to our good fortune.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain had been trying to capture manna particles that glowed the brightest the gold and silver ones to feed the nodes out of curiosity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it did not go smoothly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so this time he snuck part of his grubby little mind hands towards some of the more common teal coloured particles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was still a bit of resistance yet the flow of manna changed ever so slightly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally after a few more tries the first small piece entered his totemic soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so for manna i can control the particles hued similar to nodes better than the rest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the so-called twice the result with half the effort.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he tried to direct the manna towards some of the dimmer nodes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the process was tedious and rigid and soon sweat started dripping from his forehead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the manna was prone to randomness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it always tried to interact with the first node it encountered which often resulted in pricks of either ecstasy or pain making him positively confused.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sometimes the manna would fade away before reaching the destination.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to even mention what happened when the manna entered nodes of non-similar colours.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that means while particles of non-teal coloured manna are harder to control it is much easier to feed into a non-teal coloured node the teal manna i can easily capture.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like the red and purple ones i have.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so bloody confusing aye!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to make matters even more baffling the interaction was wholly different every time manna entered a node.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if the manna and nodes were of the same colour sometimes it would feel cold and sometimes slimy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cultivation as it stood was not so fun at all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am sure you have heard stories of past heroes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when i was your age my mother and grandmother had sung them to me too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how they took in rare manna from treasured lands with oh so much hardship!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " despite their natural talents being in certain aspects they excelled in many others.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " while it is true that even wholly unrelated aspects of manna and nodes can create epoch-changing results most of it is undoubtedly because of once-in-a-million-cycle lucky coincidences.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " very few can successfully replicate them without the heros personal guidance and most die while trying these feats themselves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if the hero leaves behind his findings in scrolls his and his descendants' body and soul will ultimately not be exactly the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this is why there are stories of so many great clans descended from such heroes declining millennia after millennia.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the underlying principle of the world is too complex for our feeble souls to comprehend.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sometimes things can start fantastic when your realm is low.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but soon you realise that you have only wasted your limited talents pursuing dreams of delusions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " remember this always the world of cultivation and the act of cultivation itself are full of uncountable dangers both within and without.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is always better to be safe than to be dead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even we the earthlochians will not tell our sons and daughters to follow the ancestors teaching line by line.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " learn from them but recognise that you are not them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how progressive?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain wowed reproaching himself mentally for thinking that all dhionne were stuck with monarchical palaeolithic views.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only most of them were.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and he completely agreed with tudors point while writhing in a moment in shame.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he forced his lazy mind to stop letting manna do what it wanted within his real estate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " fun or not better than being dead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the interactions felt extraordinarily unique when he initially let the manna flow naturally into his totemic soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but as electrifying as it was when a particle of indigo clashed with a pink-hued node the dopamine was not worth the long-term harm of what tudor foreshadowed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was still too soon to arrive at any concrete conclusions about any of this of course.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but perhaps experimenting on it would be more complicated than elrhain had initially assumed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not when the price of failure was literally death.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet why did he have to swim against the current?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he didnt want to be such a hero with a ticking time bomb forcing him to act to get better at a hundred times the speed of a normal dhionne.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could experiment plenty by simply leading teal manna on a bluish-green node.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then maybe maybe the next time he could lead lime-coloured mannasomething significantly harder to control onto the same node.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the looks of it he would have a wealth of time in the future to do so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and he would need that wealth of time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " judging by how absolutely unchanged the dim nodes' luminosity were even after thirty minutes worth of cultivation it would take many cycles of practice to light up all thousand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so elrhain decided slow and steady was the way for him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there are ten thousand ways cultivation can go wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it can take tens of cycles to light even a hundred nodes for less talented servants with limited resources.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even lesser nobles cannot consistently produce dhionne of high cultivation every generation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however we high nobles have the gifts of the spirits and the ancestors.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " our well-studied cultivation techniques ritual and array formations and alchemic elixirs will lower the danger hasten the speed and compound the power of our manna in spells and magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is enough to bridge the gap in talent and the very reason we stand at the apex of all dhionne with sky realmers in every generation and sometimes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " legends that can break through beyond the sky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but today you shall cultivate without the help of any such cultivation resources other than the manna gathering circle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this is the primal path the ancestors had taken before their enlightened minds produced wondrous cultivation techniques like the earthlochs river of all seasons and the everlasting aqua-night domain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " know of their sacrifice and the blood and tears they have shed so that we do not have to.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and so the cultivation session went on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " particle after particle of manna entered the nodes within elrhains totemic soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy himself grew both fatigued and invigorated at the same time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then something changed at the two-hour mark.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at first it was a slight prickle on his left chest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then suddenly his bloodstreams were on fire.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the totemic soul the pathways the manna had travelled in started leaking light.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it went from blue to purple then a dark crimson red.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when suddenly he opened his eyes and collapsed with a loud shriek.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he felt as if the cavern was devoid of air and his lungs were plunged into lava.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in those horrible few moments of pain his body almost burnt up from the inside out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and then just as abruptly the pain vanished as fast as it had come.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains vision cleared of red and he could breathe again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt until five more minutes later that his mind calmed enough to take in his surroundings and he noticed the anomaly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains body was covered in a shield of manna connected to tudors outstretched hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was the same for cati and agwyn who were still in cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tudor stood before them with a slight grin on his face gesturing elrhain to sit down in silence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy complied.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cati broke out of her cultivation about forty minutes afterwards and agwyn lasted an hour.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " both of them burst into tears and kept wailing in confusion for a few good minutes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would take even longer for them to stop pouting at what a bully tudor was much to the mans amusement.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain had been examining some of the runic carvings on the platform in the meanwhile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still he focused back on tudor as soon as agwyn had calmed herself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the girl scuttled up beside him the first chance she sniffed and this time tudor didnt stop her tomfoolery.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man spoke with no judgement in his voice only advice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " today i have protected you with my magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as i will until you successfully reach earthen when you have ignited all one thousand nodes and integrate the spirits ichor in your ichoric heart chamber.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by that time you would have familiarised yourself with the lattice channels that connect one node in your totemic soul to another and hopefully learned enough sense not to blindly fumble through cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but never forget that this blind fumbling is precisely what the servants without our means experience.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do not waste this privilege.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " let this be your first lesson in cultivation even when you think all is going well while you mindlessly follow your instincts hunches and cryptic tales of heroes creating their own techniques out of thin air and sheer perseverance nothing is as it seems.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cultivation is not for everyone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is not for the talented yet thoughtless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even a diligent waste can live longer than a fool chasing grandeur.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is okay if you are unambitious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a measured pace can take you so much further than someone with an unstable foundation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " living is always always better than dying.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tudor sighed as if recalling a terrible memory then clapped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other kids including vesiphis and cadfael who had perhaps finished their own cultivation as elrhain was spacing out with the runes on the circle gathered around from where they sat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is why you have me the high shaman of initiation to teach you the ways of cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cati gwyn and rhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this will be a long journey especially with the coming collapse.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i only wish that you can keep your heads calm and wills firm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the man then walked towards them picking all three up with his burly arms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he placed agwyn on his shoulder and hugged elrhain and cati to his chest much to the latters glee.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the smile on tudors face could almost rival dofnalds in a more friendly uncle upstairs kind of way.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats enough of cultivation for today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you three did a fantastic job initiating yourselves especially in your first attempt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " let us now head to the tranquil pools and wash away all the filth and grime shall we?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your cousins have been waiting for a while you know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only then did elrhain notice the oily impurities covering his body.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how had he not noticed that?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " was it the dim glow of the cavern or because he didnt feel any discomfort on his skin?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he didnt smell funny either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain ran a finger on his left arm to smear some of the oily substance and gave it a light sniff before vomiting all over a dumbfounded tudor and horrified catis faces.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 36 monsoon came too soon\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ellie can you stop sulking?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn nudged the boy lightly with her forehead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but elrhain ignored her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his face was buried into the cushion while his body writhed in indignation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had the right to pout whenever he wanted for however long he wanted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " especially since ahhhh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain quickly screamed over the memories in his stupid brain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its fine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " kids puke on people all the time!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if agwyn was trying to comfort him she was doing a terrible job.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " b-but cati keeps telling everyone she meets that i bullied her that i puked on her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how am i supposed to show my face to them tomorrow!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well agwyn stopped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she twirled a lock of her hair before answering um how about you apologize to her?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or give her a present perhaps?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you know playing cute like this is a privilege only adorable kids like us have.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we have to thoroughly take advantage of it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain remained reticent and agwyn didnt bother him anymore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she put her own pillow beside his and rested her tiny head on it with a giggle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was nearing midnight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two would have already been asleep at this point but elrhain kept groaning and shuffling left and right so agwyn could not sleep either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the occasional critter of crickets and swish of the breeze had already taken over the call of the birds and murmurs of dhionne.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the ambient sounds of nature had not an enemy to clash so their force remained mild their tone remained soothing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it made elrhains girly groans even more annoying.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he had already stopped his exasperating guttural complaints that didnt cease for hours after cyra had teased him silly during todays dinner.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to agwyn this was a big plus.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " five or perhaps ten silent minutes passed and elrhain finally unburied his face from the cushion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked at agwyns beaming face with his big blue slit eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the girl laid on her side watching him before nearing closer for a snuggle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain sniffed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so bad.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there there.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it stank like the armpit stench of a million obese gamers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my nose i feel like i have been violated wah!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its okay ellie.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sometimes everybody makes horrible mistakes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " d-do we have to continue cultivating and pushing stuff like that out from our bodies?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if some come out of the inner walls of our nose?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats like cultivation is suicide!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " aww.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im sure it will be fine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn moved even closer and pecked his forehead hugging him tightly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uncle tudor said today would be the worst.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we are so young that our bodies dont have that much impurity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so i am sure the intensity of it will go down from now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " r-really?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yup!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " trust me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dhionne who cultivate later at life discharge so much of the stuff it comes out gunky black!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ours was really transparent right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and before bringing it up way close to smell it we could not notice the stink at all!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yeah!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we gotta be vigilant!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats my ellie.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " god i love you so much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thanks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain felt as if a thousand tons of wet socks had been pulled out from his mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was tired he wished to sleep now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so the boy completely let himself go in agwyns soft embrace and took off on a journey to the dreamlands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time any nightmare whether ghastly or stinky was fought away by a superheroine who appeared in his dark visions with magical lights.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the cutest little girl scared silly all the nasty putrid monsters with her selection of high impact eau de parfum!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " god.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i had the weirdest dream last night.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what is it?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what is it!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn cati and even ysbail who had somehow snuck her way up to the platform kept pestering him like three chipmunks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before he could answer though a sullen old servant stomped his way to them and dragged the wailing ysbail away from the manna saturated cultivation stage towards a small gathering of children down below the stairs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " apparently they had uorian alphabets to learn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " both the noble and the servant toddlers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cati looked sad for precisely three seconds before she and agwyn resumed bombarding him with questions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain sighed then re-taled the tale of how he was chased around by a giant multi-mouthed frog made out of fish poop all throughout lochuir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then suddenly when all hope was lost agwyn came in from the sky and finished off the lovecraftian terror with essential oil from kokutar sweet blossoms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now his audience including siani and cadough laughed along with every wonky step of his frightening dream.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though he must admit he played up some parts a tad too much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but as long as it got laughs right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain also noticed that cati had none of the spite from the calamity the day before and once again thanked agwyn in his heart.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well he did get up super early this morning and with agwyns ingenious help drew the prettiest looking anime portrait of the three-eyed girl he could in a super expensive looking parchment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the angry little girl was at first utterly unwilling to even talk with him this morning.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the present completely blew away any animosity she had.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two reconciled with a hug as witnessed by agwyn who sported an extremely unwilling expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had supervised the making-up process all the way through with bloodshot eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if elrhain hadnt let cati go from the hug before those three seconds ended he reckoned thered be a bloodbath by now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or at least some biting and hair pulling and perhaps not speaking to each other for the day before the two little girls inevitably made up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at first it was ysbail and cati who were the best doublets.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now it was agwyn cati and ysbail the triumvirate of air-headed tiny trouble-toddlers with elrhain the grumpy guardian tagging along.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " two of the three trouble-toddlers were showing off the portrait to all the cousins uncles aunties and even servants they could spot with their five ominous eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their chests puffed and noses flared with both glory and levity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hilarities aside honestly elrhain was so proud of agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " shed been getting the hang of her emotions better lately.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even today after tudor had commenced their second cultivation session she had only tried to sit together with him in the same circle twice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one less than yesterday!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " which was a tremendous improvement!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally elrhain mused the baby girls growing up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " summer was ending but the heat blazed hotter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " looking up at the sky of lochuir one could see a firmament of brilliant blue.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the lustre of the heavens was harsher on the eyes now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the light was more luminescent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was fiercer as if its fury would crash down on the disc any minute.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " recently the frequency of rainfall had gone up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the new mountain trails were muddy and looked more like a bog and the aenraad river had spilt over on the shores of lochuir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the forest vegetation all around refused to be disposed of even after being cut down again and again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " numerous critters and insects had found their way inside the township with a mission to vex the inhabitants to sleeplessness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the fragrance of fresh flowering fruits could not take away from the dreary mood that covered the populace.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the clan had to hasten the pace of building new shelters distributing resources and electing leaders.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dingy huts and shabby houses now occupied a few of the peaks around some of the smaller lakes of lochuir which stuck out like sore thumbs among the lush jungle canopy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it broke the beautiful scenery even further when the residents had to carry up buckets full of sludge and stones to mend the rickety new villages every few days.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even with magic there was a limit to how strong they could build them to war against nature.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the high realm shamans and mages also had better things to do than settlement construction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the manna-rioghs all around the territory were growing restless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now almost every group of evacuees that reached lochuir came in with wounds and tragedy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " death rose and so did the demand for food.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the settlements nearest to the township and shire grew cramped filthy and had daily fights happening for reasons both small and large.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " more mountains had to be fashioned into new villages to suppress the rising conflicts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but even with the chaos there was a peculiar kind of order that kept the lid from blowing off.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " was it earthlochs unquestionable might?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " was it a sense of unity amidst crises?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whatever it might be it helped the upper echelon of the clan tackle the multitude of problems cropping up in timely manners step by step.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so that even the noble kids could wander around the vast territory of lochuir without too much risk.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the rest had something else to do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " apparently sianis mother would take them to see the hunt of some rare gheist.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the younger kids had also wanted to go but the adults would have none of their grievances.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they mercilessly stuff them on top of alleigh and ordered the pengyte to run around the settlements to keep the annoying brats busy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even puppy dog eyes were useless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even when ysbail and cati joined in to buff their pitiful pleading it could not leave a nick in cadwells cold-blooded defence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shamanic duo wanted nothing to do with hunts either while vesiphis refused to let the heir and heiress wander around without proper supervision.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thus they could only grumble in resentment as they stepped foot onto one of the newest mountains where a make-shift village was being set up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 37 - waterproof alchemy\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " careful my lady!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis grabbed the collar of agwyns robe foiling the girls master plan to run off to adventure for the 8th time that day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl whined for she rightfully demanded to lead an investigation on precisely how magic was used to build the dhionne shelters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however the half-finished structures looked much too rickety to let the clans only princess wander around inside.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " truth be told elrhain was also curious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he had better self-control than his weird roommate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy threw another strip of dried meat towards the drooling alleigh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the husky was as silly as ever its ears drooping pitifully the moment agwyn jumped off its back for other fun things.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so elrhain could only cheer it up with lots of food and intense head pats much to the amazement or possibly horror of the locals.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the men and women of the settlement strummed and thrummed all over the mountainside only sending some occasional uneasy glances towards the visitors.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they all seemed to be from the same tribe judging by their crests and they were all positively terrified of alleigh for god knows what.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that didnt stop the local dhionne from doing what had to be done.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shouts of men breaking open boulders warred with the cries of the women dragging up giant bundles of timbre to where the new village was gradually taking shape.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the lush flora couldnt keep the dust and soot from rising as the construction was in full gear.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dhionne didnt need cranes and bulldozers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their sturdy physique and mastery of spells were enough for any sort of grunt work.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they stacked stones inside the holes they had dug on the mountain floor as the foundation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then they inserted wooden stumps wherever necessary as pillars or beams.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " clay and mud served as a simple cement filling the gaps between the planks and rocks which acted as the walls.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some dhionne used dried grass and straws to line their roofs while others used fresh green leaves each bigger than elrhains body to keep their new homes protected from the wind and rain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally giant vines taken from the colossal trees of the primaeval forests of earthloch bound together the ramshackle structures as the last line of defence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain felt a tug on his sleeve and saw agwyn pointing in a particular direction with bated breath.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only to see one teen girl lifting up boulders with nothing but unguided manna coursing through her meridians.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " holy electrolytes!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet he knew this was but the most unrefined use of manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was something which only mortals without proper cultivation techniques employed mortals who accounted for the vast majority of earthlochs servant population.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however what amazed elrhain the most was the myriad of magic the cultivator dhionnes employed their efficiency far higher than a crude servants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt anything new to the other children but even the most basic spells that could raise a rock spike or shape mud into walls were highly novel to the two foreign souls.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though one fact elrhain had just learnt about spells from vesiphis disappointed him greatly when he speculated some of their possible uses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would seem that once a dhionne cultivated manna they could not just immediately manifest magical effects however they wished.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " spells needed strict chants and gestures to cast correctly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only with many cycles of practice could untalented servants manipulate the effects of common spells such as raise rock or mud shaping to a certain extent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " according to vesiphis the kid proud of his vaster cultivation knowledge only earthen realmers and above could even dream of freely manipulating elemental magic solely by their will alone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and even then it was a chore to do that without sufficient training.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unless one was a naeman witch of course.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " individuals who could simply sneeze and it would mysteriously turn an onion into a living breathing unicorn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mundane spells for ordinary mortals depended not on the uniqueness of their cultivation roots or if they chose to properly ignite all their nodes to reach the earthen realm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they could of course do that and it would increase the effectiveness of the spell.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but spells didnt need all that sophistry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had pre-selected steps that a dhionne needed to follow nodes and channels in certain regions of their totemic souls they had to activate to create extremely specific frames.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after which the process would actualize the effect of the spell for a price of manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " almost like pre-packaged scripts written in python 91.01 that anybody could learn to use regardless of if they even understood the logic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they could even put fire manna into water nodes and still cast water spells with them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but obviously this case will cause the power of spells such as aqua ball to be extremely weak.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then again mages would fling their middle fingers at whoever claimed spells were for losers grasping for straws.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like all else systematic practitioners did they had to elevate spells to such heights that apparently even the founders dare not offend the strongest of them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " which immediately cheered elrhain up as he now knew there was an archmage in south-eastern uorys diosca who could gather light into a spear of destruction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the same spell had once erased an army of horuxi invaders from the edge of the disc.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " isnt that a friggin laser beam?!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ugh i want one soooo bad!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy bit his lower lips in both envy and anticipation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eudav also mentioned practitioners like the wicked devil conjurers rigid druids and priests of cryptic deities who preached to do away with spirits.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " regardless of good or evil these dhionne professions each had their unique brands of spells and augurs elrhain was dying to get his hands on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy was so busy fantasizing that he almost didnt hear the raucous shouting coming from the direction the mountain trail led to.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the kids quickly exchanged glances before hurrying towards whatever was happening on the now excited husky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at the hamlet's east end huge metal cauldrons were lined up side by side boiling with ominous mixtures spewing out nasty chemical scents from the brew within.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " arfon and eudav squealed and before anyone could stop them they sprinted to the cauldrons the moment they came into view.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two fancily dressed dhionne standing there immediately put a hold on their loud disagreement with sour expressions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they disguised even that as soon as they recognized the tiny interlopers identities.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two boys obviously cared none of the social etiquettes and excitedly bombarded the younger of the arguing duo a shaman by the looks of his robes question after question after question.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were not daunted at all by the noble who was now standing to the side awkwardly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in fact it was the noble a spindly man with shaggy green hair and an ape-like snout who stood at attention at the sight of the children.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " more precisely when he noticed agwyn and elrhain lazing on top of alleigh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " master shaman what are you doing in those big pots?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked after getting down from the husky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he stood on his tiptoes trying to take a closer look at whatever voodoo or witchcraft was going on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shaman first bowed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " respected p-prince this one is just an un-mentored apprentice from the lochuir shire.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am yet far from being a full-fledged shaman.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and to answer your question it is house glue.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " house glue?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the apprentice nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to help the people here build the hamlet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when constructing a dwelling it is mixed with the mud to make it sturdier to ward off damage by the storms and rains.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ohhh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how does it work?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " arfon beat elrhain to the punch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that the apprentice thought the question over as he stirred the mixture some more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he ladled a bit out for a sniff before pouring it back in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would yet take some time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do the noble young masters know of rubra trees?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the kids nodded while eudav held up a hand shouting yes!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " those giant leaves they are using to make the roofs those are rubra leaves right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " correct.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how perceptive my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as expected of the main houses scions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes they are indeed the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rubra leaves have a certain magical characteristic that repels water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " also its sap can stick two stones so firmly together that if enough is applied it can even thwart the full-powered charge of an adult kaloxen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but why is that magical?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " normal leaves and saps also have water repellent and adhesive properties.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked and the apprentice chuckled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " certainly they do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but if you use a normal tree leaf as material to line a roof it might last this monsoon at most before it ruptures and rots.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then it will have to be changed every cycle anew.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but a rubra leaf if properly prepared can last tens of cycles if not more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the inherent magical aspect of the tree makes water shy away from even touching its leaves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " here watch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the apprentice had a servant bring back a stack of giant rubra leaves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he took one and placed the rest beside one of the cauldrons.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then holding the leaf parallel to the kids eye levels he gently sprayed some water on it from a waterskin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the kids huddled around eagerly to watch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alleigh who was left behind dishearteningly sniffed the leaves in the left-over pile before sneezing as he jerked his head away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain gasped in shock as his superhuman vision caught the water droplets float above the leaves and not touch the surface membrane at all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was completely different from the banana or taro leaves back on earth altogether magical and out of his expectations.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this phenomenon was like the the leidenfrost effect?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn guessed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " above the rubra leaf water broke apart into perfect spheres as they gently bounced off.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the apprentice started spraying more and more water even using a spray water spell but the leaf was utterly immune.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then he poured.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and finally the large volume of water broke through whatever magical shenanigan was going on and hit squarely on the leafs surface.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as you can see it works better when the water comes down in droplets such as rainfall.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even a rainstorm can hardly damage it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but even like this the apprentice stopped pouring the water and slanted the leaf to one side.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the angle was the same as how the villagers would set the leaves on the hut roofs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the water slid off like oil not leaving behind a hint of wetness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " see?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well its still a rather low-grade material so it cant do much against a dedicated magical offence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but for these people it is more than sufficient.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then the sap?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that would be harder to demonstrate as it takes time for it to dry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the apprentice shaman pointed towards the cauldron.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " here we mix the leaves extract sap along with a few other materials such as blood from specific gheists and manna core powder to strengthen the effects.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " combine this with the viscous mud that you can find anywhere and any house smeared with it will stand strong even in a hurricane.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " impressive!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain admitted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if what the young man said was true this kind of concoction turned simple mud into a modern cement-like compound.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait he thought of something i saw many dhionne bring back mud from the riverbanks and simply using them as is.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are they also using this stuff?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that the apprentice scratched his head stiffly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was then that the nobleman finally spoke up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as expected no way would the prince not notice this crucial point!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he exclaimed then introduced himself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this one is onthoakt slanout your highness!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain waved his hand nonchalantly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it had become a habit by this point responding to noble greetings with impassive annoyance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " continue what you were saying before.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my pleasure!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your highness this rubra house glue simply takes too long to concoct!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we expect this batch to finish today but its been boiling like this for a week already.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain turned back towards the cauldrons.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they looked about a metre high and half that wide.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and there were seven of these currently in use.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are they not enough?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " absolutely not.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we need a third of each cauldron for one measly servants hut.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even us cultivators have to make do with lesser and smaller dwellings far below our prestige.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my people number four hundred strong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how can we afford to wait till all the homes have used the house glue with the first monsoon of the collapse right around the corner?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if us cultivators can the weak servants cannot withstand the storms without a roof above their heads not to mention the elderly and children!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cant you simply make more cauldrons?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since metal is limited then what about using clay or stone?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was the apprentice who replied no my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these are special alchemical tools lent to us by palaikt maegan earthloch blethen of the north lakes and of course the ever so generous main house.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanout nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my meagre onthoakt house only had two to begin with so we can only depend on your kindness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this mixture is after all alchemical.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it will eat right through normal clay or stone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and more importantly while rubra leaves are plenty the sap gheist blood manna cores and even some of the other supplementary materials are harder to find.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain thought it over for a bit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there are hundreds of mountains around lochuir being turned into settlements.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course there would be deficits.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked at the two men.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are there no alternatives?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " onthoakt slanout and the apprentice looked at each other awkwardly there are but they are even more valuable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i see.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is something to worry abou-hey!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie what the heck are you doing?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy suddenly yelled his eyes glaring in the direction of one of the bubbling cauldrons.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 38 - field trip over\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl inched closer to the blazing red cauldron with the gait of an adorable pint-sized thief.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her sneaky hands reaching for a shiny glowing rock piled with all the other materials.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even ysbail and cati were there eyeing the treasure with greedy raven eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the girls perked up at elrhains sudden growl then looked back between him and the glowing rock as if they were bandits caught red-handed but wouldnt let go of the loot.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain glared at the winged boy who was supposed to be managing them so they would not get into trouble.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis replied its just an inactive manna core.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wont harm them if they dont cultivate with it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if they try to eat it you numbskull!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .err.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " never mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as long as it is harmless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well unless the handler is extremely foolish.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain tilted his head then pointed towards agwyn cati and ysbail.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hey!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the three girls protested.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn snatched up the manna core while yelling annie isnt stupid!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain facepalmed dont get too close to the cauldrons alright?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if the fire burns wheres the fire?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain peered at the bottom of the cauldrons where red lights flickered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only then did he notice the oddity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the liquid in the cauldrons boiled like crazy but there was no flare wood or smoke under them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in its place were stone slabs engraved with orange circles giving a false glow of a flame.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the heat was palpable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " magical formations.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain stared blankly at it for a few seconds not believing how he could have possibly missed that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when abruptly he felt a few pairs of piercing eyes boring into his back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his gaze crossed with cati and ysbails.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two little imps frowned as if it took a moment for the gears in their brains to turn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then they broke into massive grins throwing their hands up hooting rhain is the stupid one!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rhain is the stupid one!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it didnt take long for agwyn who had been busy wowing at the shiny rock arfon and even eudav to join in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain wanted to object but vesiphis patted his shoulder while shaking his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a sympathetic expression appeared on the winged boys face as he closed his eyes with unvoiced compassion and elrhain got ticked off even more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " honestly my lord thats totally on you vesiphis spoke.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain stared up at the sky before glancing at the adults again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he saw both the onthoakt and shaman apprentice smiling at their childish antics.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could only lament at how he let the brats one-up him in such a disgraceful manner.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two men put their debate about resource deficiencies aside for now and took the kids around for a guided tour of their budding little hamlet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " north of the main settlement far away from any watering sources such as the wells dug up or streams flowing down from the mountain ridge above were the outhouses fashioned from rocky pits hidden by foliage to give a dhionne some privacy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain wondered if people actually had to walk so far if they wanted to answer natures call but slanout replied that these werent the only outhouses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " heck they were just passing by the area and it wasnt even part of the tour!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what would the other houses think if they knew that the prince and princess visited the slanout hamlet but the first thing they got shown there was the poopy-pits?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn would not stop giggling for fifteen minutes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the hunters lodge a mini version of the shire stood near the hamlets gates at the southeast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the cultivators in service of the onthoakts house mainly gathered either here or roamed the mountains to clear out any rogue gheists that had sneaked their way in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was even a tiny healers hut and some cold caves fashioned into silos to store the wild foodstuff and hunt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what are you doing?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in fantasy stories dont magical beasts get stronger by devouring the cores of other beastseww!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl was cut short as the magical husky sneezed a bucket of snot and saliva right next to her feet as she tried to force the pengyte to eat the shiny rock.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alleigh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " gwoss!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the husky whined as it covered its snout with two paws its expression like a wronged daughter-in-laws.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain scoffed then immediately put away the glowing herb he too was planning toerr contribute to alleighs cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy looked around with shifty eyes then whistled a suspicious tune.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the children of the tribe ran around playing their little games or helped their parents with mundane tasks all over the village.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the elderly sat under the shades of huts or trees weaving clothes from reeds and vines or carving shells of nuts or insects.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were kaloxen maturas and other beasts of burden in the gheist enclosures beside the west palisades.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a flock of fliers called gurumba which looked like giant sparrows with horses heads were also nestled upon the great primordial trees.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hey annie do you know what basashi is?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uh no.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some kinda samurai sword?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nope!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its sushi made from raw horse meat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain drooled as he stared at the horse heads peeking out from the canopy if there is a bird with a horse head id reckon theres a fish too right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " imagine the flavours!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " truly this world is the best place for fusion cuisine!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl stared at him incredulously before thwacking his shoulders playfully.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then go and get food poisoning why dont you!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " your loss.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he muttered while wincing as the group had made half a curve on the not so small mountain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all in all this was one of the better villages elrhain had explored in the past few months.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the air was ambient with the clutter and clatter of cooking the peeps and squeaks of the young and the hearty high talks of the old.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone had things to do everyone had hopes for the future.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only the onthoakt and the few cultivators of the upper caste were in contrary moods sporting worried looks because they did not share the servants enthusiasm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their minds constantly churning on how to keep this peace alive.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was the same for thundham and bromwyn and all the main house echelons.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these days the dinner talks have become more serious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the adults were always irritable and they had less time to simply accompany the kids to talk about fun nothings.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain and agwyn werent hungry for attention either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they toned down their clinginess and let their grandpa be.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even eluned had lost her cheerful smile while dofnald seemed to frown more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only cyra acted like her mind was full of clouds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course that could also be a front she screened in front of the kids to not agitate them as she was the one taking care of their daily needs nowadays.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the woman did not seem to require diligent daily cultivation unlike everyone else.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she devoted her days now fretting about the rightest way to smooch pat and rub their tiny tummies to make them fall asleep faster at night.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the suns neared the horizon as the kids basked in their rays signalling that the day was almost over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain and the others bid farewell to the good onthoakt and apprentice whom they came to know as freeman adol brewer after the detailed look at the inner workings of the hamlets construction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were quite satisfied and the onthoakt was even more satisfied that the kids were satisfied.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so everyone had a big smile on their faces when the tour ended.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the visitors were just about to trek down the mountains with a merry mood on the alleigh-mobile when a thin man came rushing towards them with an urgent note in his cries.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " worry was visible on his face and his movements were laden with distress.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " evidently he did not bring good news.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lord slanout!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " t-theres another one!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man stopped before them not even caring to look at the kids or the giant dog.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " shed done well even this morning but now h-her i-im fraid it be really the swamplings curse!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stuttering he could not get a coherent sentence out without three fidgets and a twitch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but everyone present had no trouble extracting the gist of his panicked tale.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanouts ape-like face paled as his fangs inadvertently snarled out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he promptly ordered the man to lead him to harunds hut.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " and so they followed even after vesiphis and the watch member literally fell on their knees and begged them not to.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their pleading was logical.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because it was undoubtedly risky for two children to go anywhere near someone who had been cursed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since curses that can infect adults can just as quickly spread to the young.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and adults usually recovered while children suffered harshly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the two were determined to see this through and alleigh a mid-oceanic husky would only listen to its masters princess and the princesss master.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so vesiphis and the watch really couldnt stop them even if they whimpered with all their might.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain of course wasnt entirely out of his mind and took out a hexagon-shaped bone ornament attached to a leather string from his tunics pocket.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " our mommy gave this to me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its a talisman with a misty safeguard spell.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the curse cant get through if i use this right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " indeed it could not as the spell was an augur meant for continuous protection against miasma poison and similar hazards that some recently spotted gheists were susceptible to use.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would last hours with the amount of manna cyra had put in and that spell was just one of ten the talisman could employ.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie also carried an assortment of protective magical treasures with her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she dangled them in front of their grumpy guardians with glee so vesiphis and the watch could only sigh and relent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but they did not allow cati ysbail arfon and eudav to follow.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis resolutely brought them down from the mountain towards the main house for complete magical cleansing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the younger kids did not make matters difficult for him either as they sensed the gravity of the situation with their sharp instincts.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the time they had caught up to the onthoakt a sickly woman presumably the cursed was being carried out from a small hut on a floating stone bed by a lady dressed in a healers garb.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " likewise may your mighty clan tide through this blessed collapse with nought but triumphs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the youth looking to be about 18 to 19 cycles old bowed deeply with a sincere smile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his slightly blue-tinted white jadeite eyes cast a respectful glance at the siorrakt while the diamond crown on his head gleamed with soft pearly light.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if the north was entirely under earthloch control that didnt mean other people could not traverse its lands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in fact all cycle round delvers and explorers from all across the disc would risk their lives to venture deep into the fractured tundra peninsula on the other side of earthlochs primordial forest and the dim subterranean abyss thousands of meters under the earthlochs lakes and mountains.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " whether it was the haughty elementalists of the oumental diuvakty or the cunning sea stalkers of the ruolf eyrshakty even the ever so calm second prince of the impelakty who was proudly called as the griffin prince of yuriel were staring up at the heavens jaws gaping eyes as big as pumpkins at the miracle of the wake of a hundred thousand spirits.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each and every high nobility clan had gone through the same at least once in their history.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or how else could they have accumulated so much wealth and strength to stand at the apex of the disc?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the archive keepers of the various dominions recorded the last instance fifteen thousand cycles ago when the newest juyakty rose to prominence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that time it wasnt because of two little toddlers doing their weird betrothal rite but by gathering thousands of manna-riogh hearts to forcefully tear apart the firmament that lead to the blessed white void.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even then the scale was less than one one-hundredth of this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so yes they watched till their eyes bleed greed and their face twisted with rage and jealousy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why them?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why the northern barbarians who know not civility?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the house that would wish to see that happen the least was of course it is unfortunate that i could not say my congratulations to the prince and princess personally siorrakt earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet it pains me to say that i must leave today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the gazes of the manna and spirit spawn grow hostile to us by the day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the only thing i can leave is the paltry gifts the impelakt himself has ordered me to bestow upon the two heirs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " prince yuriel zwei spoke with a forlorn tone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then passed on two small yet extremely fancy-looking swords to an earthloch servant waiting by the side.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i would have liked to bestow these star cleaving blades directly upon them but alas i shall not be rude to insist.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and i am sure that with such heaven blessed talents i will certainly grace myself upon their presence when the north uorys opens up once more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is my dearest wish that when that time comes the greatest siorrakty of the lands and the divine impelakty itself can forge a bond stronger than the strongest metal once more.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " even a sky realmer could comfortably use them with little loss of manna output if they did not have a better weapon at hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these were perfect vessels for totem too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " truly what a paltry giftno bestowal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn sneered but his face was all smiling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is as the second prince says.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when the time comes a new era will have already arrived.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then thumped his thigh with the might of a kaloxen and guffawed by that time it will already be the stage of you youngns and us uncles would have long retired.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " be sure that these blades would have seen the lives of a hundred thousand collapse-crazed gheists by then!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hahaha!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " prince zwei bowed respectfully once more then gently stood up before turning towards the doorway to leave.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his wings fluttered even without wind his posture that of an ancient sculpture of a male god.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if this was just the beginning of the collapse the treasures it could provide for them along their travels would be better than anywhere else on the disc.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were fearful yet greedy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was something bromwyn had no trouble noticing yet what could he do?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " keep guard of their grubby paws till the last of the outsiders left their siorrakty borders?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn shook his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then smiled thinking that today would be the last day he had to deal with this sorry lot.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he didnt follow them out not even the impelakty prince.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " which is why he did not see the frosty glint in prince zweis eyes as the impelakty scion exited the grand hall.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few hours later far away from lochuir sitting on top of his mount prince zwei cast one last glance toward the township.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh i really do hope you like our gifts siorrakt earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " our impelakty has been striving hard since the last disc war to plant within the savage north the bestowals of true nobility.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he looked away yet i fear you might have to start all over from a juyakty again when the collapse ends.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the ebonbeak also known as the mighty winter gryphon under the youth felt its masters emotions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it let out a sky shattering roar scaring all the other beasts in their massive convoy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the other nobles did not dare complain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for the gryphon was a peak oceanic realm gheistrum a creature that could wipe them all out alone within half an hour if given a single command from the prince.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but they didnt have to.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because each of these nobles were also friends of the prince and friends of the earthloch working hard day and night to deliver the light of the impelakty upon those northern savages.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " roar!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the ebonbeaks howl echoed once again hearing the cheers of the dhionne and the fear of the beasts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " prince zwei ran his hands through the gryphons silver fur.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his ears picked up more in the applaud of his followers than it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was a laughter to hide their distress to hide the shame of having failed the most crucial mission given directly by the impelakt himself in the last tens of cycles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after all it is but a gheist.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " prince zwei lamented.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it could not understand the difference between righteous anger and ashamed indignation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because it thought the prince felt the former but it was actually the latter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " worm cursed luck!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " prince zwei clenched his fists hard and bit his lower lips.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just five more cycles and this renegade siorrakty would be done for.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his mind once again screamed with the same mournful question as that fateful night why did the collapse come now when our plans to subdue the north were just about finished?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 40 past of the earthloch blood\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a curse!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " didnt mother say dhionne dont get sick easily?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she never said dhionne not once get sick just rarely agwyn looked thoughtful and in most cases curses arent like typical diseases.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats why they call them curses because the stronger one is the more likely it originated from malicious magic of either gheistrums or manna-rioghs!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the patient of the curse a young wife who looked around 20 now lay down on a bed of leaves and hay in the open yard in front of the hut.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her deer-like ears twitched as she weakly tried to open her sunken eyes but the healer stopped her telling her to sleep as she fed her a clear brew from a clay cup.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a circle of magic lit up above the young wifes stomach under the healers command and after a few minutes of hand gestures she let out a tired sigh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she then gently placed her ear on top of the patients belly as if listening to something and by the seconds her face became paler.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by now the cultivators had chased away all the unrelated people and the only ones left there were elrhains trio along with the husky adol slanout the healer a few of the cultivators and a young man with green skin and leafy hair sitting listlessly on the hut's doorstep.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " behind him there was an elderly couple who shared his features looking forlorn as they tried their best to comfort the young man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that should be harund and his parents perhaps?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl was more interested in what the healer was doing though.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ah.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn suddenly blanched.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whats wrong?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " s-shes pregnant!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she replied sure of her judgement.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain frowned then asked the onthoakt just to confirm.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " but very rarely do they die.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " onthoakt slanout shook his head as if he had given up all hope then walked to young harund and patted the mans shoulder.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the husband who looked no older than his wife finally could not hold it in anymore and broke down into wails.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my wife!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my child!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he cried hysterically.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " she slept so soundly like the world was now but a song of peace.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he held her hand his own quivering as though the same song had torn his heart into pieces.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why?!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why us?!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ahhh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt a pretty sight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but no one mocked harund not the strong cultivators and not even adol who had been quite haughty when speaking with servants during their brief tour.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they simply looked lost.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the only thing they felt was empathy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " looking at the other dhionnes expressions as if they too could relate to harunds pain elrhain remembered one of his conversations with cyra a few months ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my my my oh my little rhain why are you so naughty!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " said the malicious slug woman as she did her third raspberry on his chubby little tummy.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy protested go make agwyn a little brother or something!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at first he simply meant that as a light joke.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the mighty sky realmer jolted back as if stung by a bee.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra stared at elrhain with a cloudy look on her face then turned to look towards the sleeping agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for a second a thousand emotions passed through her visage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sorrow melancholy rage unwillingness despair denial and finally acceptance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and then she sobbed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ah w-what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was flustered his hands waving in front of him in a panic.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " i-im sorry!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra didnt speak just hugged the little boy and rubbed her wet face on his recently raspberried belly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hey!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " youre taking advantage of me again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ahahaha cyra suddenly burst out laughing then wiped away the tears from her eyes as she looked at elrhains own her two glossy irises laden with a mothers unmasked love.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " rhain you say the strangest things sometimes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ey gwyn will have her hands full when you get married.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain tilted his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he did not know what was up with this woman.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " but her eyes were red.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it didnt seem like she was faking it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but one thing was for sure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even though he was always exhausted as a beached whale with all the violent hugs and cuddles from his two mothers in recent days he had to admit it felt good.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was a privilege only toddlers could enjoy and secretly in his mind he decided to take full advantage of it!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but later.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because it looks like cyra had something important to say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he took a few breaths of time to steady himself and looked her in the eye again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the now not-so-bubbly slug woman gently stroked his bushy hair as she lay down beside him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you dont know how much you mean to us you mini meanie.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked the other way sweating nervously.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he inwardly contemplated if the klutzy slug woman had found out about their transmigration.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " not just you but gwyn too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you two little smarty butts!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra giggled then gently turned his head to face her.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " you have to live a long life!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it doesnt matter if you dont cultivate or if your talent is low.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well find a way to raise both of your realms together in the safest possible way.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all you two have to do is be good and play cute!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " you know of uncle stormfelt right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ya uncle moryss pops?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i heard he was err he passed away?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he thought for a bit before asking wait then what about all the other uncles and aunties?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but another kiss on the cheeks was her reply aw look at you such an adult-wike face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so cute!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stop it!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what happened then?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you cant just quit at the important part!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay geez.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " brommy morys meredith and brigdhe are the only four directly from the main branch.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone else was actually part of the side branches of our earthloch main house.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " smart choice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain praised and cyra booped his nose with a grin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " listen rhain its not so easy to make a little brother for gwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not even mentioning that i am a faediaga even for normal dhionne marriages it takes tens of cycles for a girl to be ready for a babe again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the egg has to be nourished with good manna rich food and medicine and the wife cannot take in seeds willy nilly.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " you understand what i am saying?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain shifted his eyes but nodded nonetheless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " aww you little pervert eluned is so naughty teaching you these.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or was it the archive keepers those old creeps!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain didnt correct her misunderstanding.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sorry grandpa archive keepers this air-head is the one at fault for coming to the conclusion!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " anyway we cant just bear kids whenever we want.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it takes blood flesh and so much heart and soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the real reason is the child-taking curses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unless a babe is nourished sufficiently in the womb they can succumb too easily.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do many newborns die in our siorrakty?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with complicated eyes cyra affirmed yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one in three for the servants since they can barely collect enough nutritious manna-rich food for the wife.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before father thundham beat down all opposition to support elder croneira in her work it was also about the same for nobles.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " b-but i don't think i can explain complicated medical terms in uorian with my lisp!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " w-what if they hear wrong and- agwyn wanted to let elrhain be the one to propose the potential cure for this 'swampling's curse.'\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or at least the dehydration induced by it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and yes the symptoms servant nana showed were undeniably of severe dehydration.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was something elrhain and agwyn could identify at a glance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " many epidemics in the history of humanity on earth have led to epoch changing tragedies with one of the notable ones being cholera.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the outward manifestations of this dhionne curse made the two kids recall the conditions of people rescued from nuclear polluted settlements from deep within the wastelands where many mutated diseases ran rampant.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " immediate analysis and vaccine production were not possible most of the time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hence agwyn's reclamation company had guidebooks written by various experts on the field on how to best reduce or even wholly treat symptoms of the most common plagues diseases and radioactive illnesses that the fate-forsaken denizens of the nuclear wastes were so prone to suffer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was why agwyn was actually more knowledgeable than elrhain in emergency first-aid.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but she had extreme insecurities about speaking up in front of strangers with her broken lisp.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if she had been practising to fix her speech she was nowhere near confident to speak up in such a serious moment!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it does not matter!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since we will use knowledge from earth that can tangibly affect this world we have to be super careful not to raise any suspicions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " especially with auntie lillian!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she's too sharp and will definitely hound me if i am the one who comes up with the idea.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but when you do it you can just say that you read it in some memoir but cant remember the name.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all you have to do is play cute.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if you lisp then thats also fine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " use it as a weapon the most lethal kind against which even the barrier of gigantomachy is useless!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain took a deep breath then continued.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone knows you only read some scrolls because you have nothing else to do when i scour the archives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats why it's not strange if you only remember some titbits from a random scroll but forget other details.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since this is the first time we'll use the 'i read it in a scroll' excuse we can brush away the suspicions without too many complications.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i mean.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i hope so.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " you be the vanguard and i will support you from behind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i like that you called me cute but i feel you are insulting my intelligence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " y-you misunderstand!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain stuttered as his enthusiastic gaze wavered for a second.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy then kept urging her to go forward and agwyn finally complied.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " indeed her lisp was one of her sore points.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the real reason she wanted elrhain to be the one to speak up despite knowing that it might raise some eyebrows was because she wanted him to gain the prestige that he deserved.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was growing tired of all the snubs calling him unworthy of her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn sighed before clasping her cheeks hard and skipped forward with her signature' cute little girl jumping on a rain puddle' hop.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain gave her a thumbs up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl snorted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she donned the cutest expression she could muster while tugging on slanout's sleeves uncle slanout um why doesn't the l-lealing auntie give the weak servant auntie more water and salt?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn's sudden actions took aback the onthoakt and he could not answer for a while.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lealing?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " salt?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " healing!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you see annie read in a s-scroll in grandpa archive keeper's cave that you have to make the weak servant auntie drink water honey and salt juice!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i don't understand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but before slanout could say any further servant harund heard their conversation and looked like he saw a ray of sunshine in the abyss.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " p-princess!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the young man abruptly kowtowed in front of agwyn making her a bit frightened.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this unworthy servant begs you!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will give my life to you if- servant harund!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " watch your mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you want the clan to punish you for disrespect?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how dare you talk like that to the- agwyn saw the situation turning in a direction she didn't want so she had to bring out her ultimate weapon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she sobbed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the whole venue turned as silent as a grave.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn's soft whimpers echoed for a while as she used her palms and the hemp of her robe to wipe away her tears w-why won't you l-listen to annie i just want to save the weak servant auntie and her baby.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanout scratched his head not knowing what to do while harund's face lit up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " t-truly can you save her?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the scroll said so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if the weak servant auntie drinks salty and sweet water many times today she will get good.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " other discs do this and the weak aunties there can beat curses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie isn't lying!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i saw it in the scroll honest!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was then that elrhain joined in like a cavalry saving the day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little boy held agwyn's hands and spoke out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if you don't have better ideas to save the baby in that aunty's tummy then it's either this or death.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as the words left his mouth both slanout and harund paled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time even harund's parents joined him in kowtowing to the two and no matter what the onthoakt said it could not stop this despairing family's pleading.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain insisted besides since annie read this in a discwalker's memoir in the archives i think it is worth a try.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanout alternated his gaze between the two kids then the watch member who stood awkwardly behind them and finally towards the cursed female servant who lay there on the bed of grass.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he saw harund's bleak yet hopeful gaze and the emotions on the face of the cultivators who were listening in on their conversation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after all they too had family members in the mortal realms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a terror like the swampling's curse did not have eyes or conscience it did not choose who to infect and who to not and servant nana wasn't the only pregnant woman in the settlement.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " earthloch siorrakty's subjects whether cultivator or not had an ingrained sense of worship towards the main house deep in the bones.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the legendary grand elder the chieftain and chieftainess and the great shamans and mages in their service raised nothing but confidence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to them they could do no wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanout being an onthoakt was still clear-headed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after all the princess was but barely above three cycles old.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if she was of the ruling house how vast can her knowledge of healing really be?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " true it was an impressive feat that she could read memoir scrolls at a tender age.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he would not put his absolute trust in a child.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was common sense.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " kid's her age could not tell the difference between a rock and a fruit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the fact that almost every common dhionne in the siorrakty worshipped her after the girl had caused the heavens to collapse a season ago would not suddenly turn her into a wise sage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but as the prince said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were grasping at straws.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the swampling's curse did not have a cure as far as slanout knew.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the only choice was to grit through the pain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet even if the curse passed the damage it can cause to a village if not correctly handled can be devastating needing many cycles to fully recover. '\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe it is better to let the princess do what she wants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who knows' the onthoakt thought then he called over the healer who was resting at the side after depleting her manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the tired woman greeted the two children with reverence at first but frowned as she listened as agwyn lisped out what she had read on this 'scroll'.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " weirdly enough even though her speech was a mess the incoherent words and sentences were making sense the more she spoke.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " despite that and the fact that the girl made good points on how the illness in the scroll and swampling's curse showed familiar symptoms it did not raise confidence in the healer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is not advisable to let the cursed eat or drink anything other than medicine until the purging is completely over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " food will simply irritate her bowels worsening the purging.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " b-but the scroll!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn indignantly raised her hands and the healer glanced at the awkward slanout with tired eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this may be unrelated but agwyn and i read a lot of memoirs of delvers and discwalkers in the archives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since they use simple uorian letters and not the runic of cultivation scriptures.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it's fun reading about all the experiences they go through and the things they see in so many foreign lands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and in many travel stories about the three great deserts of uorys diosca they wrote about discwalkers who lose their way suffer from severe cramps in their muscles sunken eyes and wrinkly dry skin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just like the weak servant auntie.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was specially mentioned in the scroll about the foreign curse agwyn read if i remember correctly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dhionne settlement afflicted by the curse was situated by a desert oasis.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my lord the lost in the desert do not suffer from irritated bowels or purging.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the symptoms you have mentioned are caused by a lack of waterhuh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes as if their muscled had shrivelled up like dried fruits!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dhionne of that unknown disc and the weak servant auntie here too!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the villagers there could tackle the curse since they were already familiar with curing these symptoms for generations.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " likewise even if we cannot solve her irritated bowels there is a chance that we can at least do something about the rest of the symptoms by following the cure agwyn mentioned!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain exclaimed ignoring the amazed eyes of the adults around.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he knew that it was jarring to articulate so smoothly like adults as a toddler but he had to do what had to be done.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " also why can they drink medicine and not other things?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i don't believe the onthoakt would spend high-grade medicinal elixirs for a servant so you must make the medicines with mundane herbs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " am i right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and tell me do these medicines have light ingredients such as water honey and salt?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the healer pondered for a while before finally nodding much to the good onthoakt's awkwardness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so i don't see any problem letting servant nana drink thisthis different kind of simple medicine annie read in the memoir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it's not like we are forcing the weak auntie to eat a kilogram of meat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " standing beside elrhain agwyn pitifully chirped along can you let annie save the little baby in the auntie's tummy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " p-please?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i promise i won't be a bother.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " which was the last hit that broke through this tribal healer's mental defence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 42 - salty sweet and a little bit strange\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the healer was not a narrow-minded person.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course she understood the logic in elrhains words.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to mention her heart squeezing like a sweet and sour berry at agwyns upturned eager eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but she like everyone else in this era grew up with a rigid understanding of the world just as the generations before her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " from the time she was an apprentice to now she had essentially never ventured outside what her master had taught her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " treatments elixir creation spells everything that she learnt came from knowledge passed down through hundreds of cycles of accumulated wisdom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the only thing remaining was to gain enough experience in the real world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to know when to apply which knowledge for the best viable treatment of any patient.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this had always worked for her and even if the existing knowledge could not help a patient in time like servant nanas case it was okay because that was but fate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nobody would hold her responsible.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as for experimenting she had neither the resources the talent nor the courage for it unlike her genius peers training under the great shamans and mages in the elders rest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so her rigid knowledge of healing told her not to accept the drivel of the two kids who had obviously never laid their hands on a genuine scroll of medicine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet her real-world experience told her the exact opposite.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her experience told her that if she didnt use every conceivable mean to treat the cursed who now fought with pain the unborn babe who warred with death then was she still a healer?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she took a deep breath and again massaged her temples with two fingers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally after much hesitation and rumination the healer pushed back the rigidity and agreed to princess agwyns idea making the little girl jump up in glee.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " onthoakt slanout immediately had his men bring a few clay jars a large basin of stream water salt rocks from his dwelling and a broken honeycomb from the cold cave used as food storage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn yelled from the side that the water had to be boiled for at least fifteen minutes then cooled to be drinkable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so the ape-faced nobleman ordered his servants to bring a heating stone from apprentice adols place of work.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was one of those heat inscribed stone slabs used to boil the alchemic mixture.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the healer interjected.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she asked agwyn will a purifying spell do?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thus after half a minute of hand signs and mysterious incantations a soft red glow enveloped a jar that had been poured full of water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the stream water inside seemed to discharge murky impurities as tiny dark brown specks which gathered into a small bead above the waters surface.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the healer nodded in satisfaction at her handiwork then removed the bead before getting a servant to throw it away in the dirty pits.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and thus all the glistening water that was left was perfectly safe to drink!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl wowd at the convenience of magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she then eyeballed the jar to measure the amount of water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " um about 2 litres?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i think so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " getting elrhains confirmation she pinched some crumbled rock salt from a small pouch and added it to the jar.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she continued until approximately four or five teaspoons were mixed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then she took a clay cup and filled it with honey halfway adding to the mixture.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " stir it!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn told the healer and the older woman complied.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats how a simple homemade oral rehydration solution was created for the first time in earthloch siorrakty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the healer and the onthoakt looked at agwyn with uncertainty as she drew a bit of the solution with a cup and drank it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was pretty comical how she gagged while crying salty!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she added more honey and water while taking a sip now and then until she was satisfied.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its done.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i can save the weak servant auntie now!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanout and the healer exchanged a glance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my lady does it not need alchemical- im not a lady.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am annie a cute little girl.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you can call me princess agwyn okay?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " princess agwyn does this remedy not need any other manna-rich ingredients?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanout asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nope!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its done.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " healer auntie has to make weak servant auntie drink a fifth of this jar every fifteen minutes until um.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn put her fingers on her chin then muttered until she stops twitching?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even before the onthoakt could say anything harund took the jar and a clean cup and dashed to his wifes side.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " gently!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " gently!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she is weak.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the healer shouted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then with a groan she helped the young man carry out agwyns order.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn patted her skirt with a serious grunt as if she had worked a long and tiring day then scurried back to elrhains side.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you cant.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you have to supervise them to know when to stop.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or if the saline is really working.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " fine.agwyn pouted then hopped her way to the healers side.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked at the scene with an obscure expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no one knew what was going on in his mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my lord- erm prince elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanout said with an awkward smile it is truly lamentable that you had to see our villages incompetence today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whatever may take place we are all grateful that your honourable selves care so much about the weak of our earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you dont believe the remedy will work?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain grinned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he hid the fact that even he was unsure if this magical variation of severe dehydration could be treated by non-magical means.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the direct question from the three-cycle old took aback the experienced slanout.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he only sighed saying the grand shamanka and grand elder sing high praise of the prince and princess every chance they get.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course everyone in the siorrakty whether or not noble bears full trust in the two inheritors.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain didnt ask the man any further questions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he clicked his tongue then turned towards the watch member standing at the side.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i reckon the main house will send some people to pick us up in a while?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " depending on how fast lord vesiphis reaches the earthloch manor an hour or two if i am to guess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then looked up at the evening sky continuing before the 10th night hour at the latest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded his gaze returning to agwyns busy back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " heh she was so squirmy before but now look at her enthusiasm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " baby girls growing up too fast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " compared to her clinginess a few months ago this independent activity was a tremendous improvement.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the healer wiped the sweat from her forehead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even though she was a low earthen realmer and her physical strength was admirable it was strenuous to carefully hold servant nana up and make her drink the remedy the princess had concocted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had to keep repeating this every ten to fifteen minutes and it had been almost two hours already.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " two moons had been unveiled and the third had peeked its pink-red face in the dark of the sky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at first servant nana showed a violent reaction which was typical for anyone cursed by the swampling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the moment the healer held the clay mug at servant nanas lips she fiercely resisted her weak arms finding strength from who knows where to push it away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her body kept jerking as if struck by thunder and her eyes opened wide with only a hint of life in them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " young harund had jumped up in horror and the healer wanted to wait until servant nanas condition was more manageable before administering the concoction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the princess was adamant.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " force it!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the few times after that were just as rough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sometimes only a few drops of the medicine would enter servant nanas mouth and other times most of it would spill on her clothes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but even though a lot of it was wasted like this the materials were readily available and more jars of this saline as the princess called it had already been prepared.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the only other time the healer had to force an ailing person to undergo treatment was when wounded hunters were brought back from perilous hunts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to treat the ripped flesh and shattered bones despite the patients pain was her duty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but this was different.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the healer felt as if she was going against her creed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however as time passed and her body became more fatigued the healer noticed a peculiar change in servant nanas situation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her skin was no longer so wrinkly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " t-this the healer could not help but gasp out loud bringing her hands to her mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " servant harund apprentice adol and even the onthoakt looked at her in confusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but she had not the mind to care.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she carefully ran her fingers over the curseds skin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn grinned i told you annie could save her!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the lustre of the skin was not the only change.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " her muscles had relaxed as if she was asleep.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the swelling at her joints had visibly receded and her limbs were no longer so tedious to move.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this expectant mother was still visibly famished with thin arms and sunken eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but her breath the healer put away the distracting thoughts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she could dwell on them afterwards.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for now she had to take careful notice of any other change in the curseds situation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a quarter of an hour one more cup of the mixture.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and again and again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally the healer once more put her hands on servant nanas stomach.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a gesture of a spell and a glow of blue light.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the healers face grew complicated.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she removed her hands and placed her ear on servant nanas slightly enlarged belly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with each of nanas breaths the healers head would bob up and down with the rhythm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she carefully took in the bodys condition and the babe inside.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and as those breaths drew by the countenances of those beside tensed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " on the eve of the third moon ultimately unveiling and the dancing choir of the night cicadas as a backdrop the healer let out a long tired sigh and relaxed her body as she plopped on the ground.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " kond looked at servant nana.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " young harund quietly sat beside the ailing maiden wiping her forehead with a cold grass weave.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the young man should be the one most anxious for answers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the long hours that passed seemed to have returned the servant to his bearing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is how most servants were.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rage denial and acceptance of their fate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " kond did not know if harund had calmed down with a sense of trust that the princesss remedy could save his wife and child.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " kond smiled thinking of the little girl who was biting her fingers standing at the side.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " truly she was the divine daughter of the spirits!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it worked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she blurted out not wanting to keep the impatient audience waiting any longer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the manna in servant nanas flesh flows smoothly again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and so does her womb.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " aha ha salt water and honey.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn cheered from beside with a great jump.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " servant harund stared at them blankly but his mother thwacked him with her scrawny hands on the head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the youth broke out of his trance then a colour of profound veneration flushed his pale face.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " and now you know of the cure as well healer kond as you are the first healer to help the princess realize the cure upon a sufferer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in times like these you should be proud.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " proud i say!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " kond laughed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was amused at this young apprentice alchemist who had been trying to so obviously court her for the last few days.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had noticed his gaze since the day they travelled to this new settlement under the shire shamankas orders.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before she was confused about his fondness since that was the first day they had met.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " indeed she was proud.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " both at her newfound willpower to defy her masters unbending disciplines and at her ruling clan which was undoubtedly under the eyes of the benevolent heavens.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " prince elrhain tried to dodge with a pale face but the princess moved like the twilight shadow deftly clutching onto her prey then stumbled on a pebble as her bodyweight tumbled them both towards the ground.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " luckily the watch member had a quick reaction and caught the two kids who were now pulling each others hair.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uh intimacy they are engaged right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " onthoakt slanout mused within.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but amidst these adorable antics he noticed a particular point some nobles had revealed to him a week earlier when he had just arrived with his people on this mountain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the victor of the two toddlers battle for supremacy was decided in a heartbeat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the triumphant princess now hugged prince elrhains neck with her chubby arms and coiled around his waist with her stumpy legs from behind.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " his east and west lakes peers claimed that the prince had nothing but a farmhand servants talent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanout could not discern the validity of that statement without the help of a corresponding ritual.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still it did seem like the prince was far feebler than the princess even though they both were nurtured equally by the main house.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet slanout was not keen to believe every word of those two factions with their conflicting ideologies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because from his own observations the prince was far brighter in mind than the childlike princess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was more intelligent than adult folks slanouts own age if he were to be truthful.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his way of expressing logic and justifying the princesss proposal for the cure was akin to a truth-seeking mage or an impelakty scholar.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the princess on the other hand though far stronger in body prowess than the prince seems to have random mind spasms?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a curse of another sort perhaps?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanout blanched then slapped his face hard with his hairy palms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he should not be even conceptualizing such heresy!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and besides wasnt she smart enough to read scrolls from the archives at barely three cycles old?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " which familys toddler could do so other than the prince?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanout remembered that it took him until he was well into his teenage cycles if his memory served him right to master uorian symbols.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even then he could barely read the mundane uorian scripts used in non-cultivation scrolls such as discwalker memoirs and life recounts of past slanout elders.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he would have instead wrestled a racadger than read something so bland.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because fighting a gheist would actually take less time willpower and energy!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " onthoakt slanout slapped himself again just to be sure he would not accidentally blaspheme.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oooh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when slanout looked down the princess had dragged the prince by the hand and stood in front of him with mouths agape.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are you slapping yourself because you feel dumb for not believing annie when i said i could help save the weak servant auntie?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanout was speechless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the princess grinned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she patted his legs as if she were his elder its fine there arent many people smarter than annie.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you dont need to slap yourself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " behind her the prince had practically fallen down from laughing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he gasped out at the princess thats an impressive achievement considering your parents!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before slanout could even register the horror in his thumping heart from the nonchalant princes absolute preposterous line of words an ethereal voice sounded from all around with a wave of rage palpable in every word spoken.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh is that so?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two kids jumped up like spooked rabbits then ran in the opposite direction from where the mass of blue and green water swirled into existence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a breath later the frame of an incensed faediaga stood there with bloodshot eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what did i tell you two about staying out late!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " humph is that so?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now you two dont even listen to mommy huh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra crossed her arms and pouted her foot stomping on the ground repeatedly like clubs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " were sorry the two kneeling kids whimpered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but no i dont believe you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " also why are you kneeling on top of alleigh?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " alleighs fur fluffy!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra snorted this time she didnt have to fake it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but for some reason her irritation at the two died downwind and she recalled what had just transpired.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the kids ran to alleigh in a hurry as soon as they heard her voice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they then woke the sleeping pengyte up and told it to lie on its belly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before cyra could even reprimand them for their irresponsible behaviour they had climbed on top of the gheistrum and started kowtowing in cyras direction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alleigh only arfed confusedly from beneath its tongue sticking out trying to lick the pouch of meaty snacks elrhain had placed down beside its snout.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra was so stunned she had almost forgotten what she wanted to say then had to stop herself from clapping her hands in admiration.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " truly her daughter and son were the cutest in the world!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had even learnt to act pitiful before being punished!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but no she could not spoil them too much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had to instill proper values into these two smarty butt chipmunks as the clan matriarch and an outstanding mother.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra picked them up from alleigh with her tender aqua vines then placed them on her lap belly down butt up and raised her hand overhead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain realized what was going on and screeched like a wronged husband how dare you vile woman!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how dare you disgrace me like this!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " while agwyn sobbed mommy doesnt love annie anymore!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra paled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her resolve to be a strict mother melted away like the last snow of snowrend and she could no longer bear to let her hand fall.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to spank the two pitiful kids like how her maids educated their sons and daughters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " n-no!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mommy loves you both the best!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she hugged them with an agitated heart and started showering them with as many snuggles and smooches as she could.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i-i know its actually alleigh who stopped you from leaving early right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the pengytes fur stood up as if it was bitten by a thunder eel and it yelped wretchedly before dashing down the mountain with its tail between its legs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " captain anouk?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra narrowed her eyes towards the dutiful watch member who now shivered like he was ten feet under iced water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the watch member captain anouk shook his head left and right as hard as if his life depended on it stammering t-this t-this one h-hic!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra turned her gaze away and finally glared at the noble lord of this settlement who stood gawkily with no aristocratic grace.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or was it the dhionne of this village who wanted to gobble up my cute children all by themselves?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " slanout almost fainted at the accusation as he kneeled banging his head on the dirt ground so hard that soil and gravel exploded out in all directions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the loud boom echoed like the shattering of a boulder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " every member of the settlement present from kond and adol to the hunters and mages from young harund to even his aged parents followed the onthoakts lead as they prostrated to beg for mercy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i accept my punishment for troubling the prince and princess!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we accept our punishment oh mighty faediaga.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " legs were shaking tears were falling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " couples hugged their spouses and parents hid their children.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but behind all that fear there was a silent fortitude.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no one ran.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no one blamed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when the servants of this village looked at her children there was no accusation towards them for the punishment they might suffer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only gratitude.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra tilted her head in confusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she had just joked light-heartedly to cover her embarrassment at not being able to admonish the children but this reaction she looked down at the two cute criminals sitting on her lap and asked in wonder what exactly happened here?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her daughter suckled on her thumb while her son hid his face by pressing it against her bosom.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra grinned then asked the same question to captain anouk who had by now regained his nerves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the man was still frightened anxious he had wrought upon himself the chieftainesss wrath.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but after one more glare from cyra he faithfully recounted what had taken place throughout the day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 44 - a flight in the right direction\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra remained silent throughout the onthoakt's portrayal of today's event.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but her expression grew more complex as the nobleman the apprentice alchemist and the healer described the deeds of her two little trouble sniffers with increasingly more enthusiasm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you the sky realmer picked agwyn up not knowing what to say.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " north palaikt blethen will send someone to confirm what you said soon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " upon hearing that onthoakt slanout bowed his head as low as his ape-like body allowed.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " understood!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn waved her bare hands at their back as a farewell.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra stood up dusting her pale blue chiton.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when everyone left her eyes peered at the two kids again with a sense of unease.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain and agwyn like rabbits under observation started squirming.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " w-what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain stuttered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra averted her gaze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nothing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im just wondering since when did you cuties learn to keep secrets from mommy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " y-you cant make up lies about us!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain fiercely denied and agwyn nodded while covering her face behind elrhains bushy hair.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra snorted picking the two up by her filaments again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a film of water protected them as her body collapsed into a stream floating in midair.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont think this is over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyras voice came out from everywhere around.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im going to cuddle you till you share everything after we get back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im going to kiss you both so much that you will beg me to listen to what you have to say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain rolled his eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before he could say anything though the trio gently shot up to the sky and made their way back north where their home mountain lay.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " along the way from up among the dancing clouds agwyn tugged elrhains sleeves and pointed down at the myriads of cliffs and peaks surrounding the loch sagathan and the tens of hundreds of other lakes of lochuir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the unveiled moons showered the night sky with their unending lustre the sparkling stars and the crisp monsoon breeze proved to them the superior beauty of a rainless night.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyras magic protected their bodies from the cold.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still the two appreciated this magic adventure of flight with all their soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were not at all uncomfortable lying on a bed of gliding water as they gazed at one settlement after another.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the total residential area of lochuir was no bigger than a modern metropolis of post-old-age earth.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " these scenes passed beneath their sky voyage like a fast forward movie reel.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the fires of the dhionne at night for light and for cooking shined on the disc-like stars fallen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some were burning on paths for the weary while others were flickering obstructed inside crude huts and shacks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tiny figures wandered back and forth with only a shadow of a shadow seen from so far away some in the woods and some in the pathways.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the noise of the ending hustle and bustle didnt reach them but the sight alone conveyed the frantic lives of the dhionnes trying to settle down in an unknown land.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though for some now might be the time for sleep to these dhionne rest was but an extravagance that the collapse stripped away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the blood tears and sweat to build another home for themselves the loss of joy and of good food the absence of a nights rest as they toiled even after the midnight sky had sung the melody of the goddess of slumber just so they could live a safe tomorrow elrhain smiled knowing that they had today taken the first step in easing some of those worries for their unintended victims.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " come tomorrow the dhionne of earthloch will no longer fear the swamplings curse.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn nudged closer to him laying her head on his shoulder.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " well be there soon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyras soft voice echoed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he too was fighting off the sleep as hard as he could.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " her nose was sharp and her eyes narrow with long fluttering lashes.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the prince blushed and averted his gaze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he reckoned that this lady palaikt was pleased because of what he and agwyn accomplished yesterday.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally opposite to the lady of the south stood the head of the last faction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a silent man radiating elegance with his magnificent mane everyone else too sat as gracefully behind him as if disrespect was the same as dishonour.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " his long golden hair braided neatly were jewelled with a ruby embedded wooden pin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " from time to time he would whisper softly with his followers his feline ears twitching and his beastman face breaking into a gentle smile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even though these southern nobles were in the clans grand hall they seemed to regard this noble beastman higher than even the grand elder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but unlike elder sonora and palaikt sabhalans factions they took no part in the spitfire of insults.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he knows not what shame is not what his duties are with the curse outbreak ravaging our people!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hey!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that was uncalled for lord bevin of yuriel.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i only pointed out that the east lakes are already short of resources.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we have no more to part with your western bunch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in fact arent the western grounds more fertile of both manna rioghs and fruit trees?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why do we have to share with you and not the other way around?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what say you my brothers of earthloch of the fallaciousness of this renegade palaikt?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nonsense!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is obvious that our settlements suffered most from this curse and yours suffered least.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as fellow nobles isnt it obvious for you to lend us a helping hand?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or do you dare say that the east lakes are no longer under earthlochs rule like the rest of us?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " hahaha your weak words to sow discord will only fall into the ears of fools and no one with a smidgen of intellect will believe your kaloxen-crap.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course the east lakes will help our weak little brothers and sisters of the west.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after all it is your impotent abilities that caused so much suffering to our earthlochs denizens!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain yawned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at first wrangling like these were interesting to listen to.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but over time he got bored of them as if he was watching the same soap opera every day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats why agwyn even had a servant carry some scrolls from their room to pass the time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at least the memoirs had variety.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally when a familiar old man the scaled handed grandpa entered the grand halls and took a seat with one of the more minor factions thundham shifted his position slightly as he held a hand up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all the noise immediately settled as if their fight before had been just an act they put on too lazy to break out of their daily habits.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " good.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i see you are all spirited as ever despite the times.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then how goes the settlement of my people palaikts of my clan?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " seven thousand heads of the eastern lake have all been well arranged in the rim of loch sagathan with three hundred new arrivals the day before.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " about fifty thousand those who remain at east beyond the central boundary of earthloch are making their way here as we speak under the lead of their various lords.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the miracles of the spirits the manna-rioghs that overflow are predominantly weak ones lesser than high earthen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so their journey while will take time is not too perilous.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we will settle them in before the end of ashfall.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by mid-equinox at the latest even if there are accidents.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " said palaikt sabhalan with a bow.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ashfall was the season after the monsoon which was in turn called greysqual.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " equinox i initially hoped that the main body would migrate before the monsoon ended are there more people in earthloch than lilian said?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or is the land simply that large outside the central boundary?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain pondered while nibbling a sticky gum-like fruit he and agwyn had scammed traded from ysbail this morning for some leaf and charcoal sketches.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he saw the other palaikts also bow one by one and listened attentively as they reported the situation of their respective areas.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the remaining dhionne to arrive was about the same for their dominions and so was their expected arrival time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham nodded then praised all the lords and ladies for their hard work.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " from there he moved onto other topics.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the state of food stockpiles how the hunters were faring and about any gheist outbreaks near lochuir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just like that an hour went by and the nobles' faces became more and more unsettled as if they had an itch on a place they could not reach.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain smirked realizing how even the prime and proper thundham would be mischievous sometimes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally as some nobles were just about to lose composure being the tribal muscle heads they were thundham addressed the magma-tusk elephant in the room.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " word has reached me that there has been an occurrence of the swamplings curse in many settlements.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i urge you to affirm again but you must build the villages by the shamans teachings.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is that not the case?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dirty pits and waterways cannot mingle or of course the curses of the undergods will haunt the denizens for dishonouring the disc!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora was the first to speak up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my lord of course we have abided by the ancestral teachings!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the curse grows strong even though it had only appeared two days ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " our healing mages and shamans toil day and night to appease the undergods.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still the spread is yet unstoppable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hah ancestors teachings.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont you mean impelakty teachings of those heretic scholars?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " palaikt sabhalan mocked but elder sonora simply narrowed his eyes and didnt argue back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what surprised elrhain who had an unobstructed view of the nobles below was the clear shift in mood in south palaikts camp.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nobles there seemed to grow incensed at sabhalans mockery of the impelakt scholars even though the target of the insult was not them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " interesting.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well the south does directly border the impelakty plains.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and they are also the only palaikty in southern earthloch with no equal neighbours.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cultural exchange has a greater chance of happening as does cultural invasion!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he mused.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " silence!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham warned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " palaikt sabhalan there is a time and place for such behaviours and now is not it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will not forgive another transgression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the western lake nobles hooted while palaikt sabhalan hurriedly bent at the knee after a stiff apology.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now palaikt sonora as you were saying.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the situation is bleak and we have not a moment to waste!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for the sake of the unlearnt in our presence let this humble sonora explain carefully why we should not squabble west and east at such times.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for we are not hapless cave mutts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " palaikt sabhalan glowered but elder sonora again ignored the four-armed man with a cocky smile returning to his speech.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as you already know the start of the collapse is the best time for newborns to be drenched in the rich manna the princess has so graciously summoned down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but with the curse of the swampling running rampant i fear that the babes to be born in this golden time will either die of it or be crippled greatly even inside their mothers womb.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then grandiosely spread his arms towards the other camps.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and this is not a problem for just west lakes alone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whether north south east or even the main house at the centre and the outer circles beyond if the curse remains unchecked the very future of our great clan will be in jeopardy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what a joke it will be if a hundred cycles later when the collapse ends earthloch actually comes out weaker than before!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " babes are the future.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all else must be sacrificed to save them if we want to take complete advantage of the princesss hard-fought blessing!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so i request you dispatch elder croneira and elder landohr to our settlements where the curse hit the hardest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to relieve the future pillars of earthloch of an untimely demise!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora exclaimed his point with a swooping wave of his hand before placing them over his chest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " despite his fake elegance none of the other nobles mocked him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their faces grew grim as they too recognized the severity of the situation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what elder sonora claimed was of course farfetched.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " especially regarding the situation of the western lake nobles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he did that simply to have elder croneira treat his own people first.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but if even half of what he claimed happened then it would indeed be a horrid turn of events.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even palaikt sabhalan had dark clouds on his face and looked up straight at thundham awaiting the grand elders solution.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at first the south palaikt seemed unperturbed but his followers could not keep their calm as good as he.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as for palaikt blethen of the northern lakes she and her adherents were the only ones who could keep from losing it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " news must have spread among them of what happened two days ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " onthoakt slanout even smiled his reverent gaze crossing with elrhains as if he was giddy being one of the only few in the know of a great secret.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked away and nudged little agwyn on her bum with his pen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the girl snarled then promptly sat up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was about time for attention to shift to them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two had foreseen this and discussed heavily on how to proceed with their plans depending on the reactions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the only problem was they did not know how or what those reactions would be.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyras uneasy gaze that night still weighed heavily on their little minds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham not noticing the turmoil of the two kids didnt directly reply to elder sonoras request but shifted his gaze towards elder blethen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " regarding this palaikt blethen will disclose the steps we shall take.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rather than me who was not present during the events i believe it would be better for her and onthoakt slanout to take the helm from here.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " blethen smiled as she stepped forward with chest puffed acknowledging thundhams will as though it was a great honour.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone else looked puzzled speculating if this usually lazy northern lake ruler who did not show much interest in anything other than cultivation had sneakily come up with some countermeasure for the curse with none the wiser.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " palaikt blethens voice rang out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unlike her elven face her voice was raspy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it had the mark of ageing and a slight treble only those who have seen the vicissitudes of life could offer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just like your lot this swamplings curse rampaged in the north lake villages for the last two days too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " however i dont know if its by luck.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still definitely by the blessing of earthloch we of the coldest north have thoroughly defeated it!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder blethen did not beat around the bush.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her voice grew louder with emotion at every breath and she clenched her fist up high as if to show everybody that the north did it first!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " murmurs rose which soon broke into a full storm of agitated voices.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no one had the will to poke fun at elder blethens childish antics.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they glanced towards thundham as if to question these claims then at blethen with faces full of disbelief at the grand elders acknowledgement of the fact.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally without any warning everyone even the prime and proper utterly lost their composure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even elder sonora who had just predicted an infant doomsday was flabbergasted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he hurriedly threw the shock away and crowded with the other palaikts for answers from the north palaikt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " except for the south palaikt everyone else looked like they wanted to pry open the secrets from blethens mouth if they had the power to do so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i-is that true elder blethen?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how in discs name could a cultivation freak like you also know alchemy?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wonderful news!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i believe that the northern lakes must immediately share their gains with us to drive the curse away once and for all!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as expected of the strongest of us.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you have done the clan a high favour in this time of need.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " palaikt sabhalan beamed with an offhand joke while elder sonora demanded like elder blethen owed her money.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the south palaikt finally broke his silence and wholeheartedly praised the northern elf.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " following their lead the onthoakts and reanakts too raised the clamour by many degrees.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " praise mixed with wonder pushed away the fear and brought in a round of hope like entering an icy cave after treading miles through the arid desert.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the pressure that had engulfed the hall at elder sonoras premonitions broke away with cool refreshing sweat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but elder blethen held her dainty hand up refusing to speak anymore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she snorted then after yelling shut the fck up!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont interrupt me!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she closed her mouth as though the ruckus annoyed her mood considerably.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone understood her intentions and obediently shut up knowing her volatile temperament that did things more on whims than rationale.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would be no surprise if this moody elder refused to speak for the rest of the day just because someone looked at her wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally after a few rounds of polite urging from the three other palaikts and an exasperated thundham who was secretly blaming blethen for ruining the momentum of the grand reveal elder blethen reluctantly opened her pressed lips.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sigh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " fine but one more squeak before i finish and i am leaving.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " where was i?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uh we made the remedy of the curse the evening before yesterday.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder blethen rummaged for a bit but then recovered her earlier calm poise.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was speechless and agwyn looked heartbroken.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this ladys behaviour was not elven at all!!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before arriving here today elder blethen not knowing she had shattered two kids pure impression of her continued i have personally confirmed that it works.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in fact its completely cured all cases of the curse regardless of age and health.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the thing even worked wonders for six mothers carrying children both mother and child saved.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " those people only need some good food now and theyll be back to beating their husbands in no time!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the hall threatened to boil over once again but a cough from thundham wedged their voices shut least blethen acted up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but elrhain found it hard not to scream out at the northern fake elf to not give agwyn any damn ideas!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i have to clear one important thing before i tell you lot what the cure is.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder blethen said the first cursed saved by the remedy was not from my village.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was a sick mother a servant called nana from onthoakt slanouts domain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in fact only after he confirmed the cure to work on her and the other sicks in his village did this sleazy bastard send word of it to me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder blethen cursed then thwacked onthoakt slanouts head as if remembering the irritation she felt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the onthoakt just shrugged as if he was used to it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but then elder blethen herself tensed up and looked at thundham apologetically.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uhh it was from there under the eyes of a main house watch captain and a shire healer on duty in this bast- the onthoakts village did we dare to use the remedy on other northern lake domains.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then was it this healer who found the cure?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to be a shire healer and not from the elders rest could such a genius really exist?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder blethen shook her head but then scowled at elder sonora for interrupting her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " luckily she didnt keep her earlier promise and everyone seemed to sigh in great relief.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you misunderstand bevin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the healer was the first person to carry out the cure true.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but she only did it under the prince and princess's guidance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is why their escort for the day the watch captain who had witnessed the entire process helped us clarify the remedy to the other healers with healer kond.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hm kond is that shire healer a blood mage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh certainly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " theres no way the elders rest would pass over such a talent if it did-wait what did you say?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elder sonora hiccupped his face looked as if hit by an ogres club.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " blue and purple with a hint of pain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the prince and princesss.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " guidance?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not just him but everybody else too at last registered elder blethens sudden words.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the woman herself who nonchalantly dropped the bombshell without manner or mercy grinned like a child who had successfully pulled a prank.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " imagine my surprise!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you always told me the prince was useless but by what slanout said hes a better talker being a toddler than you are at your old age.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now eat your words you antlered prick!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes you lot heard right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " clearing your ear wont do you any good young sabhalan!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the ones to dig up this life-saving remedy from some stinky piles of forgotten memoirs in the archives the ones who convinced the stuck-up knucklehead slanout to make the cure the ones who guided kond in preparing the treatment and the ones to save hundreds of thousands of lives of our clan from now until forever are none other than prince elrhain and princess agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is none other than the blessings of earthloch that they had picked slanouts territory to tour yesterday.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is none other than their genius that they could recall a long-forgotten passage from the memoir of a discwalker deceased a thousand cycles past.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that they could pinpoint the remedy of the swamplings curse from just one glance at the patient!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 46 falling for his conspiracies\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " fck elrhain cursed looking at the absolute mayhem down below.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he didn't twitch an eyebrow when elder blethen blew her top and stomped out of the hall.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " didn't even bite back when agwyn yelled at him for being a potty mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no personality education could wait.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he'd need to act and needed to act fast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because thundham no that accursed fake elf putting them into the spotlight like this was not part of the plan or any plan he had devised.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " 'do the folks here not know of moderation modesty and presentation?!'\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they don't duh and why are you so scared?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " didn't you already anticipate that after curing cholera i mean this swampling's curse with saline water grandpa will try to push us into the public eye as geniuses?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or is this some kind of ptsd from earth?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " don't be ridiculous.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i don't have ptsd!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain snapped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy bit his thumb hard a thousand thoughts motorcycling like crazy in his brain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i thought grandpa would simply brag for a while or maybe shove it in sonora's face if he pimps his grandson again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nobles would get annoyed at best and doubtful of his claims at worst.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they would think that grandpa is trying to give us credit undeserved paving our way with stolen or bought-out achievements.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that a weird thing we once blabbered some drunk nights ago gave the main house the inspiration to come up with the cure a story like that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that would be plausible.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " which family won't exaggerate the accomplishments of their sons and daughters a little?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this way grandpa would not only give us enough feats to our name at such a young age no less dressing us up as bona fide geniuses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he would also be protecting us who are not yet mature from enemy eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that's what the wealthier folks on earth usually did.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " damn i miscalculated again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tribal idiots are much worse in politicking than collective first generations.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this this is giving us full credit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham made palaikt blethen be the one to break the news and quite dramatically too in front of most of the nobles in lochuir!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she even specifically singled me out as one of the primary contributors besides you being the main.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and these numbskull wannabee aristocrats actually sound like they freaking believe what blethen said word for word.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now this news will spread until everyone and their grandmother's pet pig knows what we did!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ahhh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sorry i don't see why that's an issue.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it's not like the lower nobles of earthloch will try to assassinate us right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you forget didn't grandpa and the big guy talk about how the other high noble clans will definitely absolutely without doubt plant as many spies as they can shove in lochuir to monitor us in the collapse?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sabotage is not beneath those who don't wish to see earthloch rise.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and there are so many precedents of high noble clans offing their enemies' talented scions and blaming them on other foes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that's why cadfael is guarded by a whole herd of watches like a golden goose all cycle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if not that then an oceanic cultivator like captain anouk.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " secondly we gotta worry about the out-tribal freemen who are settling near lochuir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they aren't earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they're something like permanent residences who work live and die here but don't get the same benefits as clan freemen or the restrictions of clan servants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they are drifters from all around the disc who just wanna make a home here and probably the very hodgepodge of the spies' activities.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " imagine if the nobles treated their own servants and family of the curse but didn't treat the out-tribal freemen?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no they surely wouldn't.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nobles see them as pests leeching off the clan's hard work even lower than the lowest farmhand servants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and these out-tribals number tens of thousands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who exactly do you think they will grudge when they see their newborn die?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the curse?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or the ones who didn't save them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " logic can go suck a butt when your loved ones die left and right and the ones with the ability do nothing to help.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these are the most primal grudges you can't find right or wrong with them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " besides out-tribals don't live on earthloch because they want to.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it's because they can't live anywhere else.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what will the other clan spies do when they see such hatred stinking out of their dirty pits?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " we will lie again?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " why are you staring at me like that?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you're scaring me!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nothing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it's just agwyn twiddled her fingers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " didn't you say that we have to be honest with our family?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain patted her shoulder ignoring his own nervousness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then kept patting while saying annie annie annie annie annie.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if the light-hearted joking would wash away his fears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my friend.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we are honest.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " sure bullshit more why don't you?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time we go with my story okay?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain groaned realizing his internal 'annie-senses' might have fired a false alarm this time.annie your stories suck!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " everything is so generic that you can predict the plot from a hundred chapters away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn pouted at least mine doesn't have plot holes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you on the other hand don't know even the basics of fiction writing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you always think that your thousands of wasted hours reading novels and playing games makes you a skilled writer but you don't really have much talent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay stop sulking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you yourself said it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we can't afford more suspicions unprepared.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it doesn't matter if the story isn't an earth-shaking sky-shattering secret.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it has to be self-contained!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and unlike your mess of plot holes where you forget character backgrounds lore and any exposition you worked out in a previous chapter my stories are all consistent!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and boring.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " contrary to his expectations agwyn didn't lash out at the insult.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " upon seeing elrhain's face squinting in wariness agwyn slapped his two chubby cheeks like a victor humiliating the loser's pride.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " or is she just being passive-aggressive?'\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ellie remember all the books you wrote in your free time?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " remember how they all flopped with netizens raining a hell ton of bad reviews on them?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and how they called you out when you used your money to buy fake viewers fake reviews and an entire army of counterfeit fans?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " remember that one book i wrote after seeing yours fail when you said i couldn't do any better and how it got adapted into a web serial which although it didn't win any prizes had at least a 6.5 out of 10 in reviews? '\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain felt a cold sweat trickle down his back.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 47 - unstable love and lies\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " well duh!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " structures!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " frameworks!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " there one entire 367-page novel done.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was dead wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn made sure that his body and mind would never forget that fact.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for a few weeks straight the little girl scrunched up her nose tussling with one scenario after another arguing with her inner muse and editor.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she bounced no ricocheted off ideas between them and elrhain until even the tiniest speck of information was not out of place.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she challenged every choice of how and why things happened in their story cum excuse the narration they would offer to the adults.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in general she made elrhains toddler brain feel miserable day in day out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt like elrhain felt physical pain throughout the ordeal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but there was no doubt that he was as stuffy as a mouldering potato.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because some might say pain would have been better for his current situation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " brainstorming for weeks as it turned out was just so damn boring!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not the type of boring where he could spend the entire day lazing around doing nothing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that was the satisfactory type of boring.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was not it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was the type where he had to do something repeatedly without an option to quit just to do the same thing the next day week and month.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the type where he opened his game library full of video games but closed it again thinking there was nothing to play.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " story writing in general was the wrong kind of boring.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally after one death and thirty years in a new world elrhain could admit to the toxic netizens of earth that becoming a fiction writer was just not for him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now he understood why writers were always so cranky near deadlines.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the sheer will it took to slog on to write just five pages of consistent narrative was too much for a newbie like him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old alex fischer might be able to bear it but a toddler brained elrhain could not.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " apparently agwyn could.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ever since the noble gathering at the grand hall that day the girl had become weird.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she was still her usual cute self of course playing and living the role of a sugar-brained little dumpling.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ever since the talk about suspicions and lies and deception they had in the grand hall that day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with their minds linked inexplicably elrhain could feel the incongruity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could make out a few of the reasons for the girls sudden shift in demeanour through her telepathic mood swings too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but whenever he tried to delve further into her psyche the answers would twist blend and mix up into a mess of anxious terror.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " people said writing fiction was good for the mind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but after much rumination elrhain decided that agwyns strangely until-death-be-done drive to perfect this excuse was anything but healthy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was the very culprit behind why her mental state was so turbid that even elrhain could not force himself to spelunk it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because even if he could not thoroughly read her mind word for word her dark emotions were telling enough of the dangers that lurked within.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn needed a change of pace.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " being the smart chieftain that he was he got on all fours and took the two kids on a horsy ride all over the mountain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after one exhilarating round of what felt like a roller coaster ride on the peaks of the alps agwyn who was picked up from bromwyns back by cyra reached her arms in the big mans direction and kept pleading with a pinkish face.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " delves down in the caves gheist rides on flying gurumbas and even a lake tour on a magical wooden canoe with all their cousins.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and bromwyn was there with them regardless of sun rain or moon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it looked like this episode had really spooked the hulking man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no matter the reason a cute dumpling daughter forgetting her fathers face was the biggest cruellest punishment a man of bromwyns intellect could ever face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he and everyone else practically worshipped agwyn like an idol so that she would forget no family members face ever again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could see that everyone had been on tiptoes after agwyn and he revealed strange knowledge.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " immediately after everyone realised something was wrong with agwyns mental state.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they took the issue as seriously more than they did manna-riogh collapses and gheistrums outbreaks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if for many days making the little girl happy was their sole goal for living.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and although elrhain hated to admit it they succeeded with flying colours.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not soon after agwyn was back to her usual self giggling at frogs doing cart flips in the mountain streams.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at least with other people.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even siani and ysbail whom she didnt seem to like much were all chummy with her during the daily cultivation classes.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the adults didnt know what to do regarding their fight even though they successfully uplifted agwyns mood.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was the first serious quarrel the two kids had.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " judging by the few shamans mages and that one naeman witch that had visited the two to do some cryptic magic and spooky wizardry the adults might even have thought that their fight had to do with the strange tether in their souls and not a real baby squabble.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain resisted the urge to tsk in exasperation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the girl had finally called for a truce and hostile facial gestures would do him no good here.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the girl loved feasts after all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unlike last times gathering at the cloistered hall however this was a kiddy picnic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " small with only a few food items that the munchkins really loved.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like the pulp of moondew fruit and that whole roasted honey snail vesiphis mowed down.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the girl snorted again but opened her mouth nonetheless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since today was the long-awaited day of reconciliation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she would let her ungrateful hubby worship her like a goddess.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats the least he could do after the stunt he pulled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain gladly complied as he answered her question.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that night you said how i always claimed i cared but actually i only acted like i cared.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet look now you suddenly started thinking about how to sacrifice your own happiness for mine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if you pamper me so much i will become dependent on you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats not love.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is extreme co-dependency.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and this this vacation is the solution?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn said with an indignant expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but elrhain could at last reread her feelings like a book.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the part about negatively affecting their companionship definitely rattled her spirits.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " anything that had the slightest chance of wrecking her hard-fought love was kryptonite to her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and she knew better than to avoid it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to her the only choice was to investigate dissect and finally resolve the problem faster than ysbail could bite back after elrhain flicked her forehead.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and this was something he could capitalize on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i see you have forgotten what we learnt in meditation classes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain tapped his head then his left chest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " remember mindfulness is the answer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we will constantly be distracted in our relationship.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " greed lust seduction silence and temptations are sure to come- like ysbail and sianis tails?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .... right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the moment we notice those distractions that can lead us astray like your mental breakdown- hey!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes thats what it was.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you scared the shit out of me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we clearly needed a change of pace and you needed it more than me.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " you cant hide how much you love everyone we can read most of each others thoughts!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " so so even if this time off isnt a solution its the start of one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i know we arent perfect.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and i am sorry for saying you arent trying your absolute hardest to make me comfortable in this unusual relationship.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what i mean is i will keep making mistakes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but just like deep breaths as long as we notice both of our mistakes fast enough we can be mindful of what is poison and what is honey.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we can definitely make it work.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i really do trust you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alright?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn didnt answer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she stared at him like looking at a wonder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like the focus of an asteroid mining laser her gaze seemed to penetrate the immaterial and pierce straight into his soul for answers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just when elrhain was about to snap his finger in front of her eyes to check if she was awake agwyn sighed then asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you say you dont know the ins and outs of a love life.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " if there was a precise border which there wasnt it would have started from the ruined loch sagathan temple and ran along the banks of the aenraad river for a few hundred kilometres.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as it was the largest noble dominion of earthloch directly under the rule of the main house it contained approximately a hundred lower noble families overseeing a few good thousand spirit blessed lakes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this also included elrhains siaglas reanakty and randumans haragol onthoakty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but both the siaglas and haragol houses along with every other noble house in all of northern uorys diosca had to be relocated within a few ten kilometres radius around the central township of lochuir because of the collapse.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and when this shift first started the central nobles who were already based around lochuir reached the township the fastest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as direct followers of the main house the land allocated to them was also the best.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt the many lofty mountain peaks that touched the sky nor on the aenraad riverside deltas from which many tributaries branched out in all directions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt in proximity to the smaller spirit lakes either such as like reanakt saphurs fishing hamlet the group had visited before.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was directly inside the lush lochuir valleys around the centre-most few kilometres near the lake sagathan estuary.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " on the small hilly peaks dwarfs compared to the everest like apexes just a few ten kilometres away such as onthoakt slanouts village or near the mouth of where river aenraad met the great lake directly under the shadow of the loch sagathan temple.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the safest place with a forest of bounty a river of treasures and the largest manna-rich lake of all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " among them villages and communities which depended on fishing rather than hunting foraging or farming on land would prefer to be near sagathan at all costs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but there was only so much room near the estuary.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so they spread out with each village getting a parcel of land throughout the southern shores of sagathan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the haragol onthoakt randumans hamlet was one such place.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was barely a few kilometres away from the earthloch mountain the residence of the main house.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and it differed vastly from reanakt saphurs village even though both were reliant on fishing as means of survival.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the haragol village was situated a way out of the sandy white lakeshore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn gaped at the beach with glittering eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lochuir had a lot of scenic sights but it lacked a coastline.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but this the sparkling sand and fresh breeze of the moist wind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this made up for it more than enough!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they could see a bustling community from the last mountain near the lake with about ten or twenty houses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was a small fence surrounding it with three entrances laid about.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the houses inside were built adequately with spacious yards and cattle sheds not ramshackle like those in onthoakt slanouts place.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain guessed that such comfort was another perk granted to earthlochs direct followers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the village proper was also of an eye-pleasing layout.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " half was situated inside the lush mountain jungle cool shadows of the nuciferous trees blocking the harsh heat of the sohwl.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other half reached towards the sandy beach facing the lake directly so that the breeze would have a guided path to flow inside.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dhionne of all ages were busy with their daily lives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the mortals hauled one maritime catch after another hunted by the cultivators.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in contrast the cultivators prepared themselves for another adventure out on the lake deeps.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the elderly gathered the skewered crudefins and bound the medium bluetorts from the shoreline all the way to the village centre.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the gheists were gutted the waste was discarded and the meat was divided out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " east of the village large wooden fence-like structures stood spanning a few meters long and with gaps too large to be used as an effective defence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " various womenfolk carried baskets full of small aquatic catch and hung strips of fish frogs or lizards on hooks on the fence-like structures.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is the drying scaffold prince elrhain randuman explained noticing elrhains gaze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded while grabbing agwyns collar so she couldnt run off towards the swarm of muscular fish gremlins.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after subduing his unruly fianc\u00e9 he asked how long does it take to dry one batch of meat?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " somewhere from five to seven days.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " prince elrhain i guarantee that the dried fish strips of my village are far superior to the shabby produce you had in that lass saphurs place.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will certainly prepare the best of the best in the feast us haragols have prepared this evening!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain rubbed his tummy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " two feasts in one day?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " could he really handle it?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his wandering eyes met vesiphiss who nodded at him with a solemn expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who am i kidding!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course i can.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain grinned then asked randuman as they trotted down the last stretch of the mountain trail what are those by the way?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " on the shore of lake sagathan many wooden canoe-like boats were placed on the dry sandy beach.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since this place didnt have a proper pier or wharf there was no place to securely anchor or tie a boat throughout the nightconsidering they even had anchoring technology.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain reckoned the locals dragged the boats onto the shore to a distance safe from receding tides after a day of fishing lest they wash away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what caught elrhains eyes was behind that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " about a hundred meters into the lake tall thin bamboo-like posts sprung up from the water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they encircled a zone of area in a half-circular shape measuring around one or two square kilometres.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each post was five to ten meters apart and the two ends of the half-circle touched the lakeshore creating a cordoned region detached from the rest of the lake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats the lontwood barrier.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lake sagathan is after all a manna-reach treasured land.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " many ferocious gheists and the rioghs that spawn such gheists lurk within.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the magic cast on the barrier posts stop them from entering inside the half-moon region.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had spotted a bunch of kids splashing around in the lake playing a strange game of tag inside that semi-circle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its good that the onthoakt had taken measures so that they wont turn into fish food.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was no such thing in reanakt saphurs village and dhionne without enough strength were strictly forbidden from entering the lake waters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " either they didnt erect a barrier because of resource scarcity or reanakt saphur had other means planned for her people.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " either way magic was freaking convenient!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as they talked about this and that the team at last left the mountain trail and reached the south-eastern entrance to the village.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it might have been elrhains imagination but he felt a magical feeling wash over his body when his foot crossed the invisible line separating the mountains from the lake village.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the cacophony of the forest creatures bugs and beasts alike that had constantly accompanied them until now faded away far into the background.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " replacing it were the cries of water birds and the slosh of waves as they crashed onto the beach.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the smell of water in the wind reminded him of the many sprouting fishing stations on the greek peninsula of the collective eager to make their ancestors proud by conquering the mediterranean life once more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unlike on earth however there were no large industrial fishing machines here.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nor were there sailors in white uniforms teeich-submarines to mine the seabed for hydrogen salt or seaside resorts packed with thrilling water attractions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the ethereal feeling the sense of self he perceived from the dhionne whose lives revolved around the lakes and its blessing was the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked up and saw a flock of white seagull like birds circling the skies.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " beneath his feet were soft yellowish-white sand mixing with the soily ground.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in front was the haragol settlement with a glistening lake as the backdrop.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the aroma of dried and cooked seafood that slightly pungent yet savoury scent that tickled his nose drifted everywhere.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the rhythmic shanty of dhionne men as they hauled a gigantic shark-like four-footed gheist to be butchered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the freshly harvested seaweed was left in a giant pile by the side ready to be dried or boiled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the large reed wicker baskets were full of lake critters such as shrimps crabs clams and creels.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " every so often teenage girls would pick them up and head towards the drying scaffolds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " certainly.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the fish gremlins he saw in other fishing villages and lochuir proper were cute furry little things.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were basically puffballs with two beady eyes four tiny paws that always made elrhain wonder how they even walked with them and a kitten-like mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " an adorable entity that reminded elrhain of a mascot character from a children's cartoon on earth something that definitely should not exist in real life but only in imagination.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he didn't mind when grandpa thundham gave him that moniker.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though thundham probably called him a fish gremlin because of his prodigious appetite and not his cuteness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as he learned some time ago fish gremlins loved everything that dhionne didnt from fish and other aquatic catch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a sort of symbiotic creature that had adapted to live with dhionne like the cats and dogs of earth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were also the waste cleaners of the river and lakeside communities gobbling up the intestines bile rotten flesh and other dirty things as though they were michelin rated delicacies.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain and even the shamans and mages of earthloch did not know how their biology worked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " probably some magicial evolutionary mishap.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he only knew that the black crystals were rich in rot aspected manna and were one of the staple tools for farmhand servants.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " i obviously and even my two sons and most other cultivators in our village were already in the earthen realm before i was conferred with an onthoakty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my house only started cultivating the claw-crimson cultivation technique barely ten cycles ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in fact my totem has nothing to do with the claw-crimson cultivation technique.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is based on a different cultivation scripture altogether.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a mediocre one collected by my forefathers ages ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unlike methods used by nobles it couldnt form nascent totem before the earthen realm significantly hampering our potential.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " randuman didnt pay his son any heed and continued unlike her elders who could only start the claw-crimson cultivation technique after already augmenting their totemic souls with unsuitable ichors she will get to experience the full might of it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " from her generation the name of haragol will only go forward and not back!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hahaha!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his own words seemed to have cheered randuman up as the old man thumped his chest with pride.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain tilted his head to ponder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tudor too had spoken of something similar before when expounding the various cultivation roots.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how lesser nobles were leagues above servants and freemen while high nobles were so far up it was despair-inducing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " earthlochs main house could accomplish what others needed earthen realm cultivation to do while only being mortal.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the lesser nobles while having workable cultivation methods had far fewer material resources.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " basically lesser nobles only got the left-overs earthloch handed out after having their own fill while everyone else got the crumbs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and even the left-over techniques were of such a high level that haragol defined them as fate changing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then what of the methods the main house themselves use?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was a fact vesiphis was also well aware of.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hence elrhain decided he really had no reason to object so much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he turned towards the winged boy in question who was having a hard time freeing himself from ysbails clingy hug.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you have protection talismans on you given by uncle cadwell right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i do!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no gheist under mid-oceanic can wound me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so you can rest assured my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " weaklings do think alike.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how effective can training be if you constantly rely on charms and talismans?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael threw a comment no one wanted to hear.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " me lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dontcha worries so much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " howell chimed perfectly ignoring the shadow boys denunciation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " besides itll be a waste if we dont get to fish after coming all the way here.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain glared at cadfael youll be fishing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael didnt find it necessary to reply.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain grunted then thought back on the dangerous magical combat rister just had with the rockfin crocofish.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his confusion came back to him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tell me how the hell is that fishing?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl giggled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " silly boy.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " yay!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " no!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ysbail and cati who were at the moment quite scared after witnessing the ugly rockfin crocofish trying to bite risters head off even after being thoroughly dead held onto the two even tighter.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would take a few more minutes of cooing and a promise to find pretty shells and rocks from the lake bed that the two girls finally relented.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " come back safe!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " your mouth moves but your voice does not reach me!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " howie busyfish come back!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cati and ysbail cried with tears the size of soybeans pearling out of their glossy eyes and elrhain had to stop himself from sniggering.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " audacious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " really audacious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yup.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn nodded then ran off and held her two playmates in a tight hug.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " midday was over but the blistering heat remained.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " on top of a few islets reefs and jutting rock formations in one section of the lake sagathan waters the three earthloch scions could feel that sunlight with unobstructed intensity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet none of them was much affected by it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis looked at the fading soft crimson glow on his hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a tiny thread of the same light connected an ethereal part of his being to randuman's the old haragol onthoakt who squatted on a ledge like rock overgrown with algae with a cheeky grin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if elrhain and agwyn were here they would have recognized it as similar to the magical tether lilian had cast to tie them to their parents on the night of blessings.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time it was romero who performed the magic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though the effect was far weaker it was strong enough that randuman could jump in to intercede at the first hint of real danger.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a fact that displeased cadfael quite a lot as his opinion of 'training' was rather barbaric.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the gloomy boy could only accept the arrangements in the face of the old man's oceanic might filled thick cranium.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after casting his magic romero had manoeuvred the boat away from the islets.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he would circle the waters to keep a lookout.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his father tasked him so that only a fair number of gheists with appropriate strength would get in this region with any more being thwarted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the high earthen mage wasn't omnipotent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was no great lake spirit to control its occupants with majesty alone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what he had were tools used by many cultivators who hunted gheists on the lake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he also had more than simple attack spells in his repertoire as a mage.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alchemic powder and strange liquids immobilizing ropes and pots full of concoctions that smelled worse than a mound of three-cycle dead fungus.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had seen the same used in reanakt saphur's place too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but even then there was a chance of failure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the scent of a dhionne's blood the shock waves in the water and the dying roars of gheists were all catalyst enough to draw the attention of unwanted interlopers.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " young master howell has yet to form his nascent totem.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " smooth angular and sleek the dynamics of the blade were optimal for underwater harpooning.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the gleam of manna randuman's eyes could discern also proved that it was no ordinary trinket.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " since itd be practice for my nascent totem later.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i see.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then theres no need to worry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i have full confidence you can be an excellent fisher with your fathers teachings!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " well then ill be off!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont slack now busyfish black meanie!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with that said the fishing enthusiast spun the talisman spear above his head a few times and then vaulted into the water like a sealion.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " man earthloch main house kids must surely eat something else since young huh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " -ha ha ha.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain awkwardly scratched his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who knows?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but my question.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yeah that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " let me think for a bit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister put his palms on his temples as if to block the high heat of the sohwl.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or maybe calling up the information was just that gargantuan a task for a guy who would honestly love to catch a wink right now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my lord knows about the basics of cultivation right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain raised his hand in affirmation teacher tudor taught me this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he repeated the concepts he knew such as the various cultivation roots and the stage names a dhionne must progress through until they arrived at the mystical beyonder realm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " teacher tudor only taught up to this point.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i really didnt ask either since i thought i could just look it up in the archives which i forgot to do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister slowly sat straight with his legs folded together from his sprawling position.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats about it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but man you can read too?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " gheistcores main house toddlers really are crazy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " -ha ha ha.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " kay.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lets see if i can supplement master shaman tudors teaching.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister looked proud of the fact for a second.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so you know that in the mortal realm you first saturate the nodes in your totemic soul which are wholly random in aspect with manna till they all ignite yeah?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after that you have to find a suitable ichor from either the spirits or some alternative sources.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then you inject the ichor into your ichoric heart chamber.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this causes the nodes in your totemic soul to magically realign their aspects depending on the aspects of the ichor itself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with that your ichoric heart chamber will gradually begin its transformation and a marrow core will start forming in your physical body.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my lord?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh please go on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im just jotting it down for future reference!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain urged the man to continue as he wrote furiously on a piece of crumbled gheist hide parchment he had taken out from captain anouks satchel.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " man you can write too?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay dont make that face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " where was i?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " right so the marrow core is physical unlike the ichoric heart chamber.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it emerges as a blood-red gem inside your heart which you can see with your inner vision.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like gheist cores?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " similar.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont know if gheists need ichor to form their cores though.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " can they even connect to the astral plane?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " teacher tudor said that everything in the astral plane like the totemic soul and the ichoric heart chamber has a projection into the physical plane.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that only beings who can think can feel the astral plane.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ah!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " right i forgot about that part.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister concurred snapping his fingers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " according to whats written in our houses cultivation scripture the marrow core is precisely the special whatsit you need the connect the astral plane with the physical plane.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since its the projection of the ichoric heart chamber you can say they are like two ends of a tunnel.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one opens in the astral plane and the other in your body in the real world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before forming a marrow core the apertures and meridians which are the projection of the nodes and channels of the totemic soul onto your body are also pretty much useless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mortal dhionne only ever uses manna for brute force.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they cant flow manna through meridians or release them outside through apertures as easily cultivators can.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these meridians spread throughout your whole body are all connected to a particular object.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the marrow core?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " smart little main house lordling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you are correct.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister praised.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what does that have to do with creating a spirit er nascent totem?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im getting to that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so after you realign the aspects in your totemic soul you can start using cultivation techniques.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since now you are finally in the earthen realm!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh so thats the breakthrough?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yeah.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and it was damn hard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister nodded as he looked back in memory lane wincing at some phantom pain long forgotten.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " usually the aspects in the totemic soul before realignment vary so much person to person that using the same cultivation technique to produce the exact result for any two dhionne is nigh impossible.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that aint a problem after the process.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if they consume the same ichor that is.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cultivation techniques each have their unique ways of refining manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what you do is you use that refined manna to connect the various nodes and channels in your totemic soul to construct unique structures called frames.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 55 the divide of totems\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain bit his lips with a face full of concentration as he wrote everything down on the page of parchment.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " frames realignment ah!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i wonder what happened to all the ichor annie accepted that night?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " can someone use more than one ichor?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just as his mind was about to wander elrhain pinched his little finger and brought his awareness back to risters words.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " frames are weird things.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister said they say that after creating a frame a dhionnes physical body becomes slightly closer to the astral plane than when he was a mortal realmer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the end goal of cultivation is after all the complete uniting of your astral plane self with your physical self.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " each step you progress in cultivation you become closer to that goal and also closer to the natural laws of the world.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ohhh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a new concept get!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister slapped his chest proudly as if the little princelings awe was a momentous achievement this habit must run in the family.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after you construct the first frame something inherently changes in the totemic soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as proof you can now feel the astral boundary and the flames that make it up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you dont have to raise your hand my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i aint no master shaman.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " um can you only see that astral boundary thing after creating a frame?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats whats written in the claw-crimson cultivation technique.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i see elrhain paused his pen his tiny face squinting in deep contemplation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister thought that the princelings expression was rather cute.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the astral boundary is what separates this plane from the immaterial astral one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since a dhionne can only construct a frame after reaching the earthen realm only after that can he harvest the flames of the astral boundary as per the instructions written in his cultivation scripture.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister stopped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before he had noticed the princess had also joined in nestling herself beside elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl smiled sweetly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister returned an appreciative nod.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this flame is called the totem flame.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the first flame you harvest is the seed flame.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this seed flame is what a dhionne uses to forge his nascent totem.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he uses the marrow core to transfer it into the real world from the other side and merges the flame with a suitable vessel.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it can be like my spear here creating the nascent totem claw-crimson spear.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or like my old man who merged his seed flames into his claws following a different cultivation technique.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i heard you can even put it in the wind a real fire or the words that you whisper.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there are many strange cultivation techniques out there after all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like cadfaels shadows?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " does sand work?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by cadfael you mean the supreme talent who is the watch commanders son?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hes the guy who gave you fighting advice earlier.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sorry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " oh that little fella.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " haha dont apologize my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was right after all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and yeah i think those wiggling shadows were a nascent totem if ive ever seen one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sand should work too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ellie do you have another pen?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i forgot to bring mine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " heres my spare.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hey!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont poke me i am not giving you this one!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister had an urge to laugh seeing the two toddlers acting so shaman-like despite their adorable antics.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait elrhain suddenly stopped you need to be in the earthen realm for a marrow core and the same to create a frame?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so wait huh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " looks like youve noticed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes to feel the astral boundary and harvest the seed flame you need to have at least one stable frame.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and to bring that seed flame outside you need to have a marrow core.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then why do vesiphis and cadfael have nascent totems?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister grinned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well my lord.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " remember when i told you frames are weird things?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain rolled his eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " duh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and that you can only create frames after entering the earthen realm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you can only create them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what do you mean?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain stared wide-eyed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister patted his knees as he spoke.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the channels and nodes altogether in the totemic soul create a spiderweb-like structure known as the lattice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you know this right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain and agwyn both nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the thing is even in their mothers womb a dhionne is already born with a few innate already formed frames in their lattice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then shouldnt normal mortals also be able to cast spells and manna techniques?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister shook his head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the innate frames are fully formed but arent initiated.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a mortal realmer first has to locate them in their lattice which is exceedingly hard for people with such low manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uninitiated innate frames are elusive things.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after location to use them a dhionne also has to ignite the nodes in that frame.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after which they must even clear the channels too so that they are strong enough to not tear under frame-augmented manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and for that rister stopped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you need extraordinary cultivation techniques.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain continued with an analytical expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " techniques that only noble houses have?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn asked as understanding dawned upon her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it seems the princess is no less smart than his highness.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister was not cheap with his compliments which pleased her little highness very much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hihi annie is actually smarter!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn puffed out her chest and rister laughed along.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " high-level cultivation techniques also describe how to bring the seed flame outside without a marrow core.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for normal dhionne like we were before we became nobles we could only forge a nascent totem after already in the earthen realm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at that point there is one important event we would have already completed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after getting ennobled we certainly changed our cultivation technique to the better one the claw-crimson cultivation technique.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i along with the other haragol earthen cultivators even re-forged our nascent totem after destroying our previous ones.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but our potential will nevertheless be less than someone who forged their nascent totem before reaching earthen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister said with a wistful sigh but his sad look was fleeting hiding itself deeply before the two kids could fully register it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is it because of the ichor?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain speculated.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since it realigns the aspects in our totemic souls can it also improve the nascent totem?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it can.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " every cultivation technique created on uorys diosca is forever based on the aspects of the ichor the creator himself consumed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nascent totem goes through an extraordinary kind of metamorphosis when a mortal absorbs an ichor.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the very act of crossing the realm of the 1st circle which is the mortal realm into the 2nd circle the early earthen realm is a qualitative change in body soul and manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this is the one metamorphosis most dhionne miss.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a nascent totem forged without missing this first metamorphosis will be far easier to complete throughout the oceanic realms than a general one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " actually in the oceanic realm it is called the spirit totem.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since throughout the earthen realm a cultivator constantly blood quenches the nascent totem with the totem flames he harvests.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this when breaking into the 5th circle the early oceanic realm from the 4th circle the high earthen realm induces a second metamorphosis.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its the reason why one is nascent and the other isnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i asked my old man once but he didnt really say much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only that i will know when the time comes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain lifted the tip of the ink pen from the parchment after rister stopped speaking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he lamented with a difficult tone cultivation is so convoluted!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister burst out laughing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this side of him was undoubtedly similar to randuman.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " damn as the undergods curses it is.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " though since you both cured the swamplings curse maybe you could cure this issue too for simpler folks like us.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister cracked his neck after exhaling deeply.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his expression playful as if he didnt take his own words seriously.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then brought his palm in front of his face and raised his fingers one by one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for regular folks at the end of the mortal realm they completely ignite all the nodes in their totemic soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they consume an ichor after finding one themselves in the dangerous wild or receiving it from their master house in exchange for a substantial contribution.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then they begin forming a marrow core.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " throughout the earthen realm they construct frames in the totemic soul corresponding to whatever cultivation technique they can get their hands on.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they forge a nascent totem with the seed flame and quench it with more and more totem flames as the number of frames increases.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at the end of the earthen realm their marrow core completes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we can drop the nascent part of the nascent totem with the ascension to oceanic.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " from what i heard from my father the oceanic realm is all about creating even more frames.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at high or late oceanic at the peak of the 7th circle using that oceans worth of frame-augmented manna and harvested totem flames a dhionne metamorphose their spirit totem once again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but for nobles we well not me since i was too late.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but for ruba and you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you can forge a nascent totem even in the mortal realm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to nobles the metamorphosis during the oceanic to sky ascension will be the third time and not second unlike the vast majority of commoners.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats why the three young lordlings out there can fight with early earthen realm gheists toe to toe.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont think they are as strong as me right now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but when they and you kids too reach where i stand today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you will be far stronger.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " here!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn raised her hand eagerly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " t-then what about the sky realm?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " beyonders?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " rister shrugged beats me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " too far away for me to care right now- hooowwieee!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont jump!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ysbails cry suddenly jolted the two mini and one young adult out of their nerd talks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain stood up and toddled to the boats edge with agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his mind prickled with a dull pain as his eyes zoomed in and focused just in time to see howell dive down into the lake full of confidence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " meanwhile sparkling sand and dark shadows rose around the other two as they warmed up their nascent totems.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the hunt for what the wild denizens of the disc called fish was about to begin!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 56 creed of one\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis took out a small clay vial from his pocket and flowed his greyish-yellow manna into it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a dim glow perfused the object and soon sparkling particles of sand trickled out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a talisman but not a spatial one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it did not carry but conjure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a system of magic the naeman witches were adept in a gift from his father and mother.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " prymeodon sand-sea.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he called out the name of his nascent totem.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " from the corner of his eyes he saw cadfael do the same as a black sheen covered the white bone blade in the boys grip.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphiss eyebrows twitched facing away before his counterpart noticed his gaze.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as the eldest cousin of the cohort vesiphis had dutifully asked cadfael if he wanted a part in his and howells plan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unsurprisingly a muttered snort calling them wimps was all he got for a reply.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well thats fine too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we have our own creeds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his is supremacy while mine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the winged boy fixed his attention towards lake sagathan steadying his mind for flawless execution of the hunt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the edges of the yellow cloud surrounding him touched the water the conjured particles serving as an extension of his senses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " while they were nothing compared to howell elrhain or cadoughs detection capabilities he would at least notice a gheist swarm bolting towards the rock formation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis went over what he knew about their target.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the sawmouth snapper.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " about vesiphiss size lengthwise these fish were predators of the lake that hunted in swarms of many.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were quick in the water equipped with well-armed flesh and bone appendages.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their jagged blade-like upper jaw could break through stones and metals alike living or not.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the saw edges were motionless but the discharge of sharp manna surrounding it wasnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these gheists preferred hunting method was to clutch onto prey with their claw-like lower jaw and split it open with their bladed saw.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but their menace wasnt restricted only underwater.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the sawmouth snappers high velocity in the currents could cannonball them out into the air borrowing their explosive momentum.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were known to plough straight into the insides of unsuspecting land beasts drinking in the shores of various lakes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after which the rest of the swarm would grab onto the dead or disabled preys other body parts and drag it and their comrade back into the water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a creature no doubt conjured by a cruel undergods nightmares spawned by a manna-riogh far into the lake depths.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but this was fanas diosca where even these sawmouth snappers were at the bottom of the food chain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were but dumb beasts that could merely act on instincts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a low-level animal may not detect the fast quakes in the water left in a sawmouth snappers wake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sand-sea bulwark!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but to vesiphis it could not be more obvious!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " baam!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the saw-like jaw of the gheist drilled into the barrier of sand with a small shock wave as a blue shadow leapt up with a blur.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis held strong with confidence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he opened his left wing and flapped swerving his body in the opposite direction evading the second sawmouth snapper as it ambushed from behind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only two?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " surrounding the algae-covered islets more dark shapes moved erratically.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the bloodlust was palpable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " four five ten twenty-two!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the moment he finished counting one shadow dove upward as the water above it swelled before bursting.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was howell!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with an excited shriek the shark-eyed boy sailed over vesiphiss head while holding the end of his spear in a vice grip.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the momentum of the now thrice-extended manna-filled talisman was no weaker than the gheists themselves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before howell plunged back into the water on the other side he splashed a vial of blood-red liquid directly onto vesiphiss sand-sea bulwark.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so twenty-one of them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis re-adjusted the shape of his defences.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the first part of their plan was a success.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the red liquid sizzled like fire as it came into contact with the manna on the bulwark releasing a pungent red smoke.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as if a mark of death had been planted on vesiphiss back more than half of the monster fish let out a screech of rage in his direction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the sound wave broke into the atmosphere and four sawmouth snappers vaulted out with bloodshot eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis grinned slanting the sides of the bulwark so that it would partially divert the impact.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the gheists slid off without much resistance but the effect of the blood smoke remained.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they circled back with renewed ferocity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not bad considering howell mustve used some of the lures magic when baiting these gheists.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hiya!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " speaking of the boy howell jumped out of the water again this time from the right of the islet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the retracted spear in his hand was wedged between the snapping jaws of one of the gheists bending slightly as the gheist tried to chomp down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the sawmouth snapper looked perplexed while howells grin sang with exhilaration.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then they plopped back into sagathan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a second later a pained roar different from the bloodthirsty one before wailed out making vesiphis wonder exactly what howell did down there.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could not see as the water there was now a murky brown clouded with gheist blood.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the rest of the swarm jolted away at their comrades death cry their instincts seemingly wary of the pesky two-legged spike-thing creeping in that brown fog.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " despite the first kill the overall frequency of their attacks did not lessen.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " from the side vesiphis could sense the depths of cadfaels manna and the whooshing sound of his shadowy tendrils cleaving apart the lake water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a flash of darkness and cadfael separated the upper jaw of one incoming gheists from its mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he followed up with a straight thrust after binding the creature with his shadows ensuring that the second kill of the hunt would not escape.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unlike vesiphis cadfael would instead attack than be so passive.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that was fine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because vesiphis still had enough leeway to check up on cadfael despite being pelted by the crazed charge of the gheists every few seconds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " guaaaaaaaa!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the sawmouth snappers fumed more their attacks becoming more unrestrained.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were no longer the orderly squadron of peltasts from before but a haphazard mix of violent impulses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis knew they were not in such a frenzy because they had lost two members.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no gheists didnt do that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the blood and the lure trapped the ravenous souls of these creatures inside the periphery of the islets.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some of the stronger ones tried to escape perhaps noticing the effect of romeros magic lure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but howell was ever the nuisance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the mindless few who cared not for survival were plucked straight from water by shadows blacker than the depths laden with blades sharper than swords.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " finally a few more minutes of indiscriminate assault later a notably larger sawmouth snapper with a golden stripe down its back raised half its maw above the water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it screeched the hue of manna surrounding its saw-like jaw taking a darker shade.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other gheists followed its call.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the leader's presence brought back a semblance of discipline in their midst as the gheists swam into a triangular-shaped formation.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was not nervous at all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was a subtle grin on his lips.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " at first the dark shadows on the lake's surface disappeared with the depths.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but not even a few breaths later the shadows returned.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they enlarged faster than his eyes could follow and finally burst out of the water with a deluge of manna and malice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " crash!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the biggest impact yet.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the leader right at the forefront of the swarm with half its saw sticking into vesiphiss bulwark roared like a sword screeching against a stone.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the ones that remained continued barreling in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they clawed crunched sawed and slashed at the bulwark until the despicable thing would break.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis flared his nostrils as his eyes turned a fuzzy yellow.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the leader of them nasty gheists roared so loud my ear rang with pain!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " weve uncovered so many peculiar and exotic tales in the disc-walkers memoirs stuff that the adults or cultivators never even touch since they all think anything not related to cultivation is useless.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " not just speak high talks like howell.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay geez.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so since i only read this in one such scroll i dont know if itll actually work.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but i think its worth the try!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " from now you do everything i tell you and if the spirits bless us we will be rolling in fish in no time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alright?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone echoed their affirmation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis agreed as well since he knew what had ensued in onthoakt slanouts village.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the threats about foul smell didnt deter them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as long as the area was clear of fish-gremlins that is.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain barked more orders.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a bucket-full of hooked teeth from the sawmouth snappers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " small chunks of gheist meat the waste parts inedible for dhionne would suffice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a club.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just in case.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he thoroughly enjoyed the feeling.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it reminded him of the time being a rich ceo.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn smiled at elrhains back then strolled towards the waterfront and sat down to contemplate.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after tonight a massive problem plaguing earthloch would vanish into smoke.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since catching fish was never the hardest part.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what came next would be the most crucial.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " handling that was her responsibility.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 59 - meat every monday!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain picked up the end of a lontwood pole about 3 metres long.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were bamboo-like in both feel and texture.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ringed hollow and fibrous.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but they likewise had differences such as the colour being a gradient of deep purple and green.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their leaves resembled that of maples with branches looking more like prickly vines.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he unsheathed a small bone knife but remembered he was a toddler.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so he left shaving of the stray branches and splits to an eager howell.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then checked the zakky vines.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were hairy the metallic blue outer layer softly reflecting the light.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at one end of the vines were large nodules bearing fronds from the base of which these vines hung down like a horsetail.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain pulled on one vine with a thickness of roughly an inch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it seemed strong and flexible enough considering elrhains target prey wasnt anything more powerful than a bluefin tuna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " take this!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he handed the vine to vesiphis.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bind one end of the vine really tight to the thinner end of the lontwood pole.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " using glue or sap too would be better but.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " our house has rubra sap!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ruba said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " good.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bring it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now um uncle anouk.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain held out the teeth of the sawmouth snapper the village kids had gathered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these werent the jagged edges of the saw-like upper jaw but the actual teeth from inside the gheists mouth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were as wide as elrhains palm and their menacing edges were hooked inward.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but rather than fish hooks they resembled flat croissants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they needed to be shaped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain drew the general outline of a fishing hook on the sand with a stick.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if this were earth they would need modern equipment to grind the bone tooth down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " using stones like cavemen did millennia ago would take too long and the precision would also be undesirable.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but understood.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " captain anouk nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had been paying attention to their actions intently.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as someone who had seen the whole proceedings in the slanout settlement the watch captain had faith in whatever plan the prince hatched up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was definitely curious about how the events would pan out and accepted the gheist tooth without complaint.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his hand glowed red as he held his serrated dagger then gently started shaving the tooth down to shape.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the manna powered labour was no less efficient than a modern-day industrial grinder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few minutes later a shining white fishing hook was completed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was a hole at one end of the hook to tie the vine and the angular shape was perfected with the tip curving inward much more sharply.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " excellent!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by that time ruba had returned with a clay jar full of white tar-like substance the magical rubra sap.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hold on ruba.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " theres something we need to do first.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain checked the shaft where vesiphis tied the vine scoring a few millimetres up and down with his knife.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " from there he measured the zakky vine pointing to a spot about half a metre up from the vines loose end.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he marked that too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cut off a piece of lontwood about a finger long.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then insert two narrower twigs any will do into the hollow inside where the thinner of the two twigs should be longer and the thicker one should be short.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " half of each twigs body should stick out too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes like that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay this thing is called the float.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " tie this to the spot i marked on the vine... that will do.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now attach this tooth hook at the end of the vine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just loop it in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis dutifully followed elrhains instructions but couldnt help asking m-my lord is this some sort of binding weapon like the chain tendrils cadfael uses?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i cannot imagine how even ysbail or cati can use this.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you dont bind you hook!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and it is not a weapon.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its a tool an instrument.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you dont fight with it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he ignored the winged boys perplexed look.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in truth elrhain himself did not know if this diy venture would bear fruit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " on earth he had used a highly mechanical motorized version of this instrument with a million sensors and sleek artificial intelligence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he knew the basic construct and design and the purposes of the various constitutive parts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but as for the more subtle significance and nitty-gritty details behind the prehistoric form of a fishing hook float and line he had zero idea.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but elrhain was confident.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if it worked for cave dwellers it would work for dhionne.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ruba giddily applied the gunk like glue on all the places the zakky vines were tied to other things.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after that captain anouk dried the adhesive using a basic heat spell.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its done!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked over his creation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a fishing pole.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a primitive one with no heed paid to physics or mathematics one jury-rigged together with anything on hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no line guides not to mention reels or handles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but elrhain reckoned the first one used by his earth ancestors was surely not any better.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ancient egyptian anglers didnt have magic either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at least elrhain didnt think so.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no one could be absolutely sure what secrets the pharaohs were hiding in their giant coffins other than onions and beetles even in the 31st century.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ugh so heavy.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the three-meter-long fishing pole or fishing rod as some called it was too heavy for a toddler like elrhain to lift and he fell backwards because of the weight of the lontwood.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain stood up again while dusting his behind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he called for ruba cati and ysbail.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn after thinking through a few complications regarding her future steps also demanded he let her join the fun.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " howell and vesiphis along with the village children looked on curiously with the shark-eyed boy literally begging elrhain to explain the ins and outs of this mysterious gadget.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but elrhain refused.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he insisted on proving that even the weakest non-cultivators could fish up a fortune with his subsequent actions not words.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the five toddlers lifted the fishing pole up high under elrhains repeated corrections.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the zakky vine fishing line was a good bit longer than the pole itself so it left a slithering line on the sand as they towed it around.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hook a small piece of meat on that tooth hook.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the village kids had brought back a leaf of meat from the butcher about half a kilograms worth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis cut off a finger-length piece from the chunk and pierced it onto the hook.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " good.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain licked his lips his voice failing to hide his excitement.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now throw that hook into the water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if he could he would have cast the line himself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that was impractical in the current situation where the fishing pole was multiple times taller than himself and he couldnt do a good rotation with his toddler's waist.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that was fine because in his plans the poles werent meant to be manned by toddlers at all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis threw the hook along with the bait towards the lake.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the line stretched a few five meters before plunging with a plop everything below the float sinking down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this section of the water was outside the cordoned off semi-circle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even in the afternoon sunlight they could vaguely see the contours of the many fish scamper away from the vicinity as the water was disturbed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mortal gheists.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they roam in infinite numbers in every lake and river of earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " seemingly the only beings excused from the wrath of dhionne.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they had manna-poor flesh that was hardly worth wasting a hunters time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for he could use the same time and manna to hunt land gheists of far higher value far more quickly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " plus anything under the earthen realm could not provide them with enough sustenance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so why should they waste their time fumbling in water for just one arms length of carp and trout?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even mortal men overlooked them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unlike a rabbit they could not simply slash a sword at them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nor could they dig pitfalls or lay rope traps to snare their ankles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " spearfishing should have been possible especially in lakes with water as clear as sagathan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but elrhain had no recollection seeing it done nor reading any mention of it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " entering the water was an even bigger folly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because these mortal fish and gheists that make up the beautiful ecosystem of the lake depths were but a smokescreen to camouflage the actual dangers that lurked within.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " perhaps far in the past the starving dhionne of those societies might have ignorantly swum into the treacherous waters without a high enough cultivation base to try their luck.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only to get bitten by a silk-thin poisonous snake dragged down under by a behemoth worm or serrated to bits by a swarm of hungry piranhas.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the lakes harboured stranger dangers than anything a dhionne might encounter above.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " on land they could run away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but in water they will drown as most do not have the organs or appendages necessary to adapt to an underwater environment like howell and rister.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for a mortal mans doom all it would take was one earthen gheistrum one beast that could empower itself with manna one monster who could move faster than his eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would throw even the most careful and daring mortal dhionne far out of his element in the face of such foreign foes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is why entering the lake outside the safe lontwood barriers was strictly forbidden.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just like how on land the great majority of the earthlochian population scoured the mountain forests for edible tubers plants berries and fruits all day long hoping to fill their stomachs with a days worth of food.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for the lakes too the best they could do was pick up the flopping creels clams crabs and seaweed left on the shore as the tides recede.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " both the quality and quantity were nowhere near enough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not even for servants not to mention cultivators.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so even if the bounty of foodstuff was right there under those shallow mirrors of blue within arms reach waiting to fill the belly of a starving dhionne with no hopes of cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " accepting that invitation was a path not to salvation but to a punishing death.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the art of fishing or hunting under the relentless waters of earthloch was a skill possessed by only a few.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were strong in their element but far fewer in number than the hunters of the land.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thus for many millennia these smaller fish and lake-gheists lived being neglected.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that was true even now in the collapse when the hunting range of each dhionne settlement had shrunk exponentially.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " although the collapse also brought a surge in the number of gheists it would take many cycles for that to go up enough to support the vast earthloch population all of which was now stuffed in the small region of lochuir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone looked anywhere they could and exhausted all means to dig out anything edible from under the dirt beneath the stone and deep in the rotting wood of dead trees.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but nobody looked for the fish and shrimps beneath the lakes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these creatures swam unabated in their nonchalance mocking how powerless the two-legged monkey-like land monsters were.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wagging their tails with no sense of crisis big plump catfishes and basses swayed close to the shore knowing that no land-lubber dared to venture into their territory.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one particularly fat catfish with the haughtiest whiskers around even had the nerve to blow bubbles at the white bone-thing the small swarm of two-legged land monsters threw down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it had juicy meat attached to it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why would they toss such fresh food?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the fish cautiously circled the suspicious afternoon snack a few times.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it nudged it with its muzzle then gave it a quick nibble.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yummy!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " manna!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as it gulped down the manna-rich meat the catfish scanned the area once more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was the largest mortal gheist around even the accursed long-spiked-hole-digger that burrowed under that spongy rock didnt dare to lay claim to anything it wanted.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as for the two-legged ones above?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the catfish knew that those monsters only went for the older and more powerful overlords of its kind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " besides werent they the ones foolish enough to throw away delicious meat in the first place?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and once the meat was in the water it was fish territory now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so the snobbish unsuspecting catfish opened its mouth wide while feeling very pleased with itself and chomped!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 60 fish fortune nothing's happening ruba said sulking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain snapped his eyes her way and urged her to be quiet with a suppressed voice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " silence was an indispensable part of fishing in his former life as any loud noise would scare away potential catch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he did not know if that was the case here but it didn't hurt to be careful.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " honestly even if he preferred otherwise it didn't matter if he failed to catch any fish after boasting so much.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he would be left embarrassed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but ultimately this was just an initial attempt a reproduction of earth's scientific knowledge in a 'grasp in the darkness' manner.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in the grand scheme of things failures were just as desired as successes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and it wasn't without reason that failure was called the mother of success.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " since elrhain now had agwyn's full support he would try one thing after another.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as responsibly as he could he would go all out to see how his modern knowledge could influence the lives of the denizens of this world for the better.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " besides the resulting clash between his knowledge of a scientific earth and the primitive yet charmed life of fanas diosca would be immensely crucial to him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for they might be the riposte to the unanswered questions of his seven decades of life on earth that haunted him constantly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the grace of luck or desire elrhain would not miss the chance to unearth them here in a world far far away with all his heart and soul.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for himself and for agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what should his relationship be with his new exuberant family?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " can he trust them and will they trust him back?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why even in the first place should he break out of his comfort zone to act like some kind of self-righteous messiah for people who are as ignorant as they are violent?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain did not know.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but he knew that to keep a healthy mindset he could not ignore his most precious wants what elrhain had determined he needed more than anything else.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and so he would try.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " try today and try again tomorrow and the day after.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " until he found his answer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " until he could see the meaning to both his pitiful past and present bright lives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the humid yet cold wind of the lake curled and curved ruffling elrhain's bangs as they gently covered his blue slit pupils.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was the first person in the toddler heap of five children grabbing onto the fishing pole.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " behind him were the slightly bored yet somewhat nervous faces of ruba ysbail and cati.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn was last.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she smiled sweetly full of trust but with a hint of something else as their eyes crossed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " within that split-second gaze it was as if the spirits of the lakes and the goddess of fate themselves bestowed upon them the last morsel of luck they lacked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the first opportunity the fuzzy space of nothingness between success and failure.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " t-theres something!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " howell yelped as loud as alleigh as he cupped his eyes with his palms focusing on the movement of the float.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a second later elrhain too felt a slight tug in his hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " woah!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the slight tug turned into a full-blown lurch as the little boy could not keep his balance at the sudden appearance of the massive force.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain slipped plopping forward with a cute ouch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the rest of the toddlers didnt fare any better each piling on top of elrhain with their own adorable exclamations as the shaft of the fishing pole was wrenched out of their hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " only agwyn with her herculean strength grabbed on to it for dear life but refused to let go.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hahaha!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even though she was dragged forward on the sandy shore on her belly like the second female victim of a deep-sea horror movie her exhilaration was clear.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " damnit!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " vesiphis grab her!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain paled not sharing his best friends glee.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he screamed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but before the words had entirely left his mouth someone else had shot forward as if catapulted by shadows.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he clutched onto the fishing pole with his right hand then planted his feet on the sandy shore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whatever beast had bit the hook tried to wrestle with all its might even dragging this mean cousin about two steps forward.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the fishing line stretched tautly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it zig-zagged erratically cutting the water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then it stopped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " great turbulence of sand and whirls was raised in the water under the battered float proving the ongoing resistance of the trapped fish.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it was futile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael simply held on with one hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shadows under his feet glued his body to the lakeshore like an unmoving tree stump.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his eyes peered towards agwyn who now stood up with a deadpan face full of sand and twigs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl let go of the fishing pole then trotted back to elrhains side without uttering a word.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she pulled elrhain out from his prone position under ruba ysbail and cati then hid like a timid squirrel behind his back.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was speechless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he coughed finding it necessary to say something to the unexpected superhero despite the little girls reluctance to acknowledge cadfael.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " t-thanks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cadfael narrowed his eyes as he looked away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shadowy boy gripped the fishing pole with both hands before he spun around and pulled swinging the shaft over his shoulder as if he was slashing down his sword.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the zakky vine fishing line whipped once more raising an audible swoosh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the water under the float ballooned then finally the beast was revealed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the children watched in awe and fascination as cadfael the quietest of the earthloch lot dragged the large flabby form of a whiskered mudlynx straight out of the water into the air.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the catfish sailed overhead like a fat slimy projectile.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it pointlessly tried to flap its meaty tail and fins its fleshy lips now hooked up to the other end of the fishing line pierced to the bone tooth hook.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thump!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it fell on the shore with a few bounces between cadfael and elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its chunky body was like a basketball springing up and down along with its jittery flips.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it let out a guh!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " and floundered on top of the sandy shore wondering why its mouth hurt why the two-legged land monsters were so close and where all the water went!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " w-w-whaaaaa- howell choked in his absolute shock.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he jumped up as if a fish-gremlin had bitten his buttocks then while windmilling his arms dashed to the fat helpless fish with stars in his eyes.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " but as if to prove elrhain wrong it performed far better.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " incomprehensibly so that elrhain suspected if there was foul magic at play.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whatever the case there was now a pile of thirteen flopping fish each weighing over five kilograms inside the basket-deep hole howell had dug on the shore to store them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one of the village kids a toddling girl a little older than elrhain hoisted a wooden club and thwacked each of those flopping fish on the head once and they ceased flopping.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " all that luminance and the fiery light of the cooking and bonfires of the feast leaked over to where the kids were having the time of their life.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " and as the club-wielding demonic little girl bashed to death her nth aquatic victim with blood splatters painting her face the same orange light graced her with a terrifying aura no preschooler primitive or not should ever have.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the contours of the old young and even children moved around with palpable avidity.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they planted torches in the sand lighting the whole place up like the late-night shire banquets.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the intensity was the same as if they had just wrapped up a major hunt out from a sinister manna-riogh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe they had.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " something seemed to click in ol bandys brain.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " didnt think of it like that.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now we cant have no one saying we scalefolks are ungrateful.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " actually let me put these two crawfish here.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the prince was saying how hed never eaten one.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " randuman continued.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because it looks like let alone twenty cycles the prince and princess have already sniffed out a solution to one of earthlochs most pressing problems today!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with that the dirty old man burst into a guffaw and thumped his trunk like a gleeful gorilla.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn could only sigh with a yeah.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he decided to leave the complicated thinking to his old man.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as a father all bromwyn could do now was protect his two gems from evil eyes and that would be enough.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " can she?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " please?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn had no defences against that despite his peak oceanic cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he could only nod like one of those impelakty eunuchs fawning mindlessly at the cuteness enraptured him.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the cooking for the feast soon wrapped up amidst everyones high morale.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " any other day all the kids would have been long asleep by this time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but tonight ysbail and cati talked about everything under the sun with ruba not minding if their words made sense or not.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " even the adults lent him their ears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they acknowledged his skills despite his much younger age and the fishing pole being out for hardly a few hours.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and for the villagers themselves the topic that dominated their discussions was one and the same.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " even bromwyn was half distracted his mind wandering back to elrhain explaining the how-to-dos of this simple yet effective object to randuman.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the feast ended in a flash and the midnight moon had already unveiled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no one cared how the time seemed to flow so mercilessly as they chattered and laughed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn tucked the two kids under the blanket and delicately caressed agwyns cheek.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl uttered an illegible sound then reflexively pushed his hand away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she rolled over and grabbed elrhains arm like a body pillow.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the other earthloch scions excluding cadfael and including ruba of haragol were snuggled into a snoring pile in the next room snoozing away.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the chieftain himself would accompany these dumplings for the night in case of emergency.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its a task he had gladly taken upon himself to spend even one more minute in his silly and forgetful daughter's company.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " how can the host run away to fish throughout the night while the guest has to remain acting as a guardian!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im his siorrakt no less.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " can i consider this mutiny?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn massaged his temples and tried to shut the haragol onthoakts loud voice out.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " they made us sit in a scrying array first thing in the morning!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it bloody sparked like pikachu.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course its tingly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn said with a vexed voice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i cant believe that naeman witch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she cut my hair!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nerve of that pompous slut!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was about two inches shorter now and it looked absolutely hideous.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " an event catastrophic enough to ruin the rest of agwyns day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thats it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn head-butted her pillow as if it could magically solve all her cosmetic problems.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont want to take this any longer.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were jotting down notes though.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are you sure?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " positively.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they can only find something after i tell them where to look for it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and i will do that tonight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i think mommy and daddy will be less cranky too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they sound so mentally worn out.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " are you sure youre sure?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn suddenly sat up then crossed her arms.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " w-what is it now?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain stammered dropping the curving of alleigh he played with.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you put up a mental barrier again!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain looked away knowing not to step into a trap intentionally.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " naturally this didnt make agwyn stop pestering.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " you have that legal right and the freedom of expression as a legitimate citizen of the collective.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the time to execute the plan weeks in the making.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but as agwyn was prepared to hurl the measured bombshells onto her familys unprepared noggins she was preemptively ambushed by the last person she wanted to meet tonight.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian stated.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she deftly moved her fingers to shape agwyns leafy hair into two magnificent tails of piglets.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " you think you will be let off?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the prince couldnt do telepathy.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will first hear your excuses before we settle on a punishment!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " i should call an all-earthloch gathering just to ridicule you for being so thoughtless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " just imagining the outcome if the situation continued unbeknownst to all of us as is disc be blessed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " when young ysbail told me you always mess around with the prince and dont concentrate on cultivation during tudors classes i first didnt believe it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ysbail that snitch!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that is no way to address your cousin!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the third knock to the head and the princess finally covered her noggin with a distressed look.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she did you right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you know what happens when the totemic soul overflows?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " do you know why earthloch scions are forbidden from entering the earthen realm before the age of ten?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if we hadnt scried your soul today then who knows what the future couldve been!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you need punishment you you infuriating little creature!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " indeed because of some suspicions of her part the grand shamanka had performed a particular ritual on the two kids today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a safe magic but quite invasive.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it had taken a good while to prepare after the upheaval with the swamplings curse.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " despite everyone elses objections lilian was adamant about finding answers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this invention of the fishing pole she had been informed about today was all the more reason.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as one of the clan leaders she had to confirm any and all incongruities with the two successors souls before any actual harm could be done.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " such misgivings were poisonous lilian knew.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but sometimes the hard choices fell upon those who cared the most.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so with the help of many master shamans her own acolytes a few rare soul mages from the shire and the naeman witch lilian set up the scrying formation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they placed the two sleepy kids in the centre and everything else proceeded according to plan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as usual the first thing lilian saw was the tether connecting the twos totemic souls.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhains was quite dim.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe a hundred-odd ignited?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " two hundred at most.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as for agwyn the moment lilian saw it she was so horrified her vision was almost jerked out of the astral plane.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " nearly all the nodes in the little girls totemic soul from the most frequent violet coloured ones to the rarest black blue every node brimmed with manna on the verge of augmenting.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wouldnt be a problem for anyone else as the process would halt there without an ichor.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but this fool of a royal dunce had literally a hundred thousand ichoric legacies hidden inside her body.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even poking her waist at the right angle might be enough for the girl to subconsciously inject a random ichor into her ichoric heart chamber.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian was scared silly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn was only three.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a peak earthen toddler!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then she felt a rage like no other she had felt in the last few decades rising from within.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn that stupid girl had kept this a secret!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for the next hour lilian continued probing for any abnormalities in the two connected souls while holding her anger at bay from interfering with her present work.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she would put a seal on agwyns ichors later when her investigations were done.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the esoteric arts of the naeman witch were certainly helpful in speeding up the process.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she caught a few details all the previous scrying had failed to discover.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " an odd light that blinked on and off branching into the distance like a snake of manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " far out in the same direction behind the horizon of the astral plane and outside the astral boundary there seemed to be an enormous spherical form.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like a dark moon looming only as a silhouette it floated in and out of the shadows of the astral clouds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dead but real.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like an opened eye of a blind giant.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 65 sneaking dreaming\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian came back to reality with mixed feelings.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the discoveries were undoubtedly worrying.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but there was nothing to be done now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at least not for this particular problem.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as for the overflowing nodes she glanced at the two kids.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their hair was fuzzed up like the fur of a lynxmean the felines of thunder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " an after-effect of the lightning manna of the formation no doubt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the princess menacingly glared at witch alorakana baring her sharp fangs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the naeman witch grinned back with her fiendish getup a lock of leafy hair in her long-nailed fingers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the grand shamanka could not help but exhale deeply.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the aspect of the soul matches that of the body.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " further treatment or auguries would have to wait.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in regular times the treasured materials required for such high-grade rituals would cost earthloch an arm and a leg if they chose to trade them from other clans.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but fortunately with the collapse they should spawn on their own in the many manna-rioghs of the north within three to five cycles judging by the records of past collapses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " until then the two kids had to constantly be placed within earshot.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not even she could foresee the repercussions if the princess and prince augmented their souls with ichors as things stood now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were too many unknown variables.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and yet and yet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this mindless buffoon!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like mother like daughter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian fumed within immediately blaming it all on the numb-sculled faediaga eldress and her equally brain-dead husband.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a match made in heaven if there was one.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its why lilian never explicitly approved their marriage in the first place.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian had already made up her mind as the ritual formation lost its light.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyns immediate family would never ever have the heart to reprimand her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they treated her like half their souls.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they spoiled her like an ancestor.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would be up to her the calm-headed auntie lilian to set things straight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so here they were back in the present.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " supper was already over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two dumplings had been kneeling on their pudgy legs for the last ten minutes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a gallery of heartbroken half-wits wiped their tears at the side.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they need this so the lesson will stick lilian growled at them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then turned her sharp glare toward the children.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why do i have to kneel too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain muttered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " n-no one loves me anymore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn sobbed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but lilian knew crocodile tears when she saw them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " quiet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you two will marry in the future.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian saw agwyns distressed eyes light up in delight for just a second before she went back to moping.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " indeed this girl might be a lost cause for more serious intellectual matters but she was unquestionably an actor.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if you dont learn to share woes now when will you?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian said.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she looked at a pale blue leaf burning in a small clay pot by the firepit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the ashes had piled up into a beautiful dusty mountain and little of the leaf was left yet unburnt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bromwyn kept pointing at her and then the leaf.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the big guy was a shame to the name of siorrakt if lilian had ever seen one!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not to mention the killing intent she was feeling from cyra.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ah fine i get it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you two can get up now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " anything more and i will be too frightened to go to sleep in the coming days.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " both your mothers look like the last guardian of death aspected manna-rioghs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian acquiesced.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yay the little girl threw away the gloom and ran to her family.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " does everyone love annie again?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what followed was half an hour's worth of coddling confessions begging for a second chance and every other drama even a drunk storyteller could not conjure up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian was speechless.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she wanted to leave this nauseating place but a tiny hand tugged her shawl.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i-is auntie l-lilian still mad at me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was agwyn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian rolled her eyes then kneeled down opening her arms wide.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn cheered jumping into her embrace like a gossamer cloud.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " silly girl.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she replied.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i wasnt mad.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i was concerned!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you cant keep secrets like this anymore okay?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you two are special.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and you are brilliant.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unlike cati ysbail and jesta it's not like you to neglect something as important as your cultivation base.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if something happens what do you think your uncle tudor will feel?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " will he not fault himself for not emphasizing the matter enough?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " s-sorry.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i wont keep bad secrets the little girl whimpered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian was about to speak again but agwyn suddenly cupped lilians cheeks and peered straight into her eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilac pupils like a disc of amethyst.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " worry doubt conviction.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was something more there and lilian didnt know what it was.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn let go then scuttled to elrhain and whispered something in his ears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " because of her high cultivation the words reached lilians ears too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but they were strange and slurped.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian understood the individual words but when put together they made no sense.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a few moments later agwyn returned and brought her mouth closer to her ears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " c-can you keep a secret?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " gwyn?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " u-umm i asked ellie and he said okay.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " t-theres something.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " en a secret?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " y-you told me not to keep.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you wont get mad?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian didnt reply.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she made eye contact with thundham.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the old man had a solemn look on his face as he nodded.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra bromwyn and the other two looked worried but they didnt defy the grand elders command.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian turned towards agwyn and asked why dont you share it with everybody else too?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ah shhhhh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn put her palms on lilians mouth and peeked back towards her parents.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she judged the adults didnt overhear then whispered with even a quieter voice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i-i dont want mommy to get mad so soon after we all made up!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so its fine if it's me?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well auntie lilian looks like she loves to get mad every time i see her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian choked resolutely ignoring the snickers coming from the half-wits.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she then booped agwyns nose in revenge.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " huh?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " that felt nice.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no wonder eldress cyra does it all the time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she booped again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn preened revelling in the attention.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay tell me what you have to say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but if its dangerous i might not be able to keep a secret.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " wait dont pout.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " let me finish.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i promise that whatever the secret is no one will get mad at you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " really?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn held up her pinky finger.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " of course.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i am the grand shamanka after all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who dares ignore my words?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian didnt disappoint the little girl hooking her own little finger with agwyns.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " now tell me.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whats this other secret?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn squirmed for a moment twiddled her fingers as she bit one uncut lock of her hair.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she hesitated but ultimately found the nerve to open her tiny mouth again.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay so you know how mommy always tells me to never play outside after dark?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and always take a gawdian like captain anouk when we go to new places?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " gawdian?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " guardian.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes that should be obvious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so if annie and ellie go out to play after falling asleep you wont get mad?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " explain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian inhaled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you see after me and ellie fall asleep annie poofs into this big black place with my totemic soul and twinkly stars right?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " theres this door there like the shiny ones in the elders rest but i can see through them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like orange ice!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and i can go to ellies big black space where his totemic soul is after walking um flying?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " through the tunnel-hole behind the door.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but inside this tunnel there are more icy doors.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn whispered as she cupped her mouth near lilians feathery ears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " every few seconds she would turn back to see if anyone was eavesdropping.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and you know annie and ellie read a loooot of scrolls in the archive keeper grandpas cave because ellie says reading will make annie smarter than him.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and theres this one time i read about a disc where they have this grey sand that can turn into stone after adding water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a discwalker wrote it in her nemmnoir...i mean me-mo-ir?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then when ellie and me napped that night i pushed open one door inside the tunnel with ellie and suddenly we were in that disc i think?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were many dhionne in that place and they all looked the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were building something really really big with that weird sand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it didnt look like any place in earthloch siorrakty like we visit all the time.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so annie thought it was the place we read in the scroll!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but you see theres this one time when ellie got lost running inside another door after leaving annie behind.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " um ellie called it lucid dreaming and not normal dreaming?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " anyway he deserved it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " also there was a big town behind the door with metal houses taller than the trees growing in our forest.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dhionne there too looked all the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " its like they all cut off their horns and wings and tails.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it's there we saw an old dhionne grandpa making the fishing pole!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after that day we read many scrolls in the archives and finally annie found it the place we went to after falling asleep.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a discwalker mentioned in his memoir that he visited a disc long ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the disc has only one river.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dhionne living there use ropes and sticks to trap fish!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i even showed it to archive keeper grandpa.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the little girl articulated.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she described one place after another as her voice gradually grew louder.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but she didnt seem to notice that and continued her tales of travels.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ellie and i went to a place with mean-looking clouds in the sky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dhionne who looked the same there were all cursed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but there are these other dhionne wearing bright robes that covered their faces and a beautiful lady who showed up and made a juice with salt water and sweet salt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " um salt that tastes like fruit.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " im not lying!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it looks like salt but tastes sweet.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she used the juice to cure the cursed and they were all smiling and were so happy!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " annie wanted to be like that too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so i went to say hello but no one talked back no matter how much i tried.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was as if she was lost in a story she had lived herself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she described event after event and disc after disc.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " metal birds that could fly faster than sound.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " giant huts larger than the whole lochuir township.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " meat that grows on metal trees and dhionne-made fish that can stay under the void seas for months.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was all things lilian was sure even the most delusional dreamer of earthloch couldnt make up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and she was also sure that agwyn wasnt lying.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 66 - bait delegation\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dream exploration.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " or some kind of memory scrying?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " perhaps an out-of-body experience through the astral plane?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like the naeman witches?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham voiced his conjectures to lilian.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was only the two of them in the room.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cyra and bromwyn had gone to put the kids to bed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dofnald accompanied his wife to one of the manna-rioghs nearby.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " although the siaglas couple were concerned the leaders assured them that nothing would go wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they should focus on their own training.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eluned was halfway through to earthen already.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " while this was far slower than a prodigy like agwyns speed it was impressive enough for a former servant regardless of the employed special elixirs.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the faster the woman could ascend the realms the better it would be for elrhains status.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the same would be for the main house since such progression will validate thundham and bromwyns choice of heir consort.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham sipped the boiled pulp water from a coconut shell container.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he refuted his own claim after reflecting for a minute.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the latter isnt likely.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their sleeping chamber is enclosed in formations that detect intrusions or excursions of beings from the astral plane.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " grand shamanka what did the naeman witch say?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian looked out of the window as she crossed her arms and placed her index finger on her lips tapping alorakana has a theory.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it pertains to memory reading like you guessed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in her accounts something similar had happened to a witch and wizard of her clan many cycles ago.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " similar?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as in revelations of unknown knowledge in the form of dreams.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " her guess is persuasive in my opinion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what if an old beyonder monster in deaths door actually wanted to occupy one of the two kids bodies?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " according to alorakana the beyonder would most likely perish in the process no matter how powerful it was before.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham asked with a raised brow because of their tethered totemic souls?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian nodded the moonlight shining on her face revealing mirth.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the beyonder was probably gravely injured or only had its soul remaining if it even considered stealing anothers body.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if this assumption is accurate then too bad that it had to choose gwyn or rhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " imagine the beyonders shock when it saw its soul being ripped apart in two directions the moment it carried out its last folly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " besides such a beyonder would have travelled to many discs in life as most beyonders do searching for new paths to power.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like elder brother lightlaonn your eldest uncle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " with this hostile beyonders soul now fatally rendered apart it wouldnt be strange to leave behind a vault of lifeless memories for the kids to explore.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was as if the air had frozen over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham noticed it immediately and covered his weary face with a palm apologizing.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont take it too hard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is just one speculation without any evidence.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " even if its true i didnt notice it either so the blame isnt yours alone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and the beyonder had received its just retribution even leaving behind a treasure trove for both the kids and our clan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for now we have to keep casting auguries on them regularly regardless of cost so no remnant souls or foreign influence can remain hidden.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i will leave that to you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian smiled thudding the stone floor with her staff.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " you on the other hand need to deal with the whole fishing pole situation fast.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " id reckon it wont be two days before the whole siorrakty flips upside down.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " most nobles arent as dumb as they look either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they should know whose feet they really have to kiss come tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ahaha.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time it was thundham who looked out of the window with an exasperated face.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " grand elder!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the door of the grand hall flung wide with a peppy young maiden bouncing in her heart-shaped face filled with a million other emotions elrhain had no mind to even pretend to care about.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had bigger problems.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like agwyn who for some reason had the sudden inspiration to do his hair today during their weekly quality time with grandpa.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain realized bone combs could also be torture tools!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what is it reanakt saphur?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " caelusius ursan logison olbert and the rest of you.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the peppy young maiden was no longer smiling today.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there seemed to be a shadow of uncertainty on her grecian nose.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i apologize for the abrupt intrusion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there is something we would like to request the main house.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " .\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " is it about the fishing pole?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thundham sighed.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " saphur and everyone else standing behind her nodded vehemently please grant us permission to make use of this secret technique my lord!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " s-secret technique?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked with one eyebrow twitching.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then stated with indignation a fishing pole is no such thing!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " also couldnt you just ask the haragol people to teach you?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there is nothing secret about it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " saphur shook her head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how could we?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " us earthloch nobles are many things but we arent thieves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would dishonour our ancestors if we used such a miraculous device without the creator's express permission.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the punishment for stealing techniques is harsh in our clan.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she then bowed to the toddler please grant us permission prince elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain was taken aback.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thinking about it saphurs words certainly made sense.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " secret techniques in the clan included how to forge or refine magical artefacts and elixirs ways to shoot mega fireballs and how to turn their own body into a self-sustaining combustion engine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain could see how crafting a fishing pole could be incorporated into those ranks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he glanced up at thundham only to see the old man shrug.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a-alright then.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " said elrhain.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nobles cheered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but there is a price!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " their faces turned serious.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this is a technique that can assuage the hunger and hence miseries of every servant in our respective houses.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we will pay any price you deem fit for such privilege.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one noble a middle-aged man with a throat that expanded and croaked like a frog affirmed for everyone.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain grit his teeth as he continued.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we used zakky vines for the fishing line.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but in one try out of every four or five a gheist would eat the vine itself along with the bait and we had to repair it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " arent there any materials that can work out that weakness?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " saphur answered with a thoughtful expression.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " theres the thread-like fur from the orgabeasts.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it is a common gheist spawned by one of the manna-rioghs near my village.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the threads are stronger than bones of common gheists and definitely more robust than zakky vines.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " caelusius added with a croak also the fibre from houal flower stems.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " while rarer than zakky vines they will last longer with their magical aspect which grants them resilience to being cut.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the hunters of my village craft them into their armours.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain smiled hearing these answers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then you should make the fishing lines using them and not blindly use zakky vines.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shaft hook float and even bait can be changed to things more competent at their tasks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " also can alchemical refinements and magic formations play any roles like they do with your fishing boats?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the possibilities are endless.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " heck why even limit the fishing pole to a rope-stick shape?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " could you tie many fishing lines to one pole and make it work?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " how about simply tying the line to a tree near the lakeshore?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nobles gulped nodding in unison.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " by the time the first ashen leaves of ashfall fell on the disc under soothing grey winds the population of earthloch had exploded in many different ways.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " first literally.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the four palaikts of earthlochs outlying circle had finally arrived with another massive inflow of dhionne.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the raucous around the lochuir area multiplied by many folds as agwyn had to bury her ears with pillows to fall asleep.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as far as mount earthloch was from the drifting lines of incoming immigrants the commotion had little trouble irritating those who needed their beauty sleep.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not only that even the out-tribals folks who didnt legitimately serve the earthloch clan but dwelled within its borders showed up in hordes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the ones to lead this ragtag lot were many groups of independent disc-walker teams and mercenary hunters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " most nobles were not impressed and had colourful things to say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the grand elder welcomed them with open arms.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there were of course scuffles here and there and a lot of prejudice from the native inhabitants of the siorrakty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yet the leaders on both sides tried their best to keep any conflict from escalating.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it helped that the de facto chief of the out-tribals a newly ascended sky realmer and the head of a disc-walker team no weaker than any of the eight loch palaikts of earthloch was there to both preserve peace and deter any wrongful actions.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the newcomers soon settled down in the numerous peaks and canyons estuaries and lakeshores of lochuir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after a period they turned into a familiar sight as the kids got used to them.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian said that there would still be about seventy thousand more to come within the end of the next season.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the total number of dhionne would cross three hundred thousand fifty thousand higher than her initial estimation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the out-tribals alone will number equal to that extra headcount.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " meaning lilians estimate was actually correct if elrhain discounted the out-tribal population.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " if this was a few months ago the three leaders and all the nobles would have been ripping their hair-fur-leaves out thinking how to accommodate all these extra mouths.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the collapse was barely in its first cycle the gheistrum spawning rate was far below the numbers necessary to sustain so many.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " which led to the second figurative case.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after the day saphur visited the two kids and obtained approval to use and propagate fishing poles it was as if a hyper-sonic blast had rocked the souls of all earthloch dhionne noble or not alike.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it took less than two days for word to reach every settlement.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a day after that thundham convened another meeting between all nobles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this included the nay-saying east and west lake bunches too to officiate fishing with poles as a duty for the servants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time thundham repeated elrhains conditions to the masses the boy himself too miffed to even attend the talks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain himself spent that day riding a gurumba a flying gheist with a horses head and eagles body with agwyn and cyra.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everything progressed at the speed of light after the talks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before the month was over most of earthlochs food problems at least regarding servants had been resolved.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it also wasnt long before many bizarre practical and not designs of the much-worshipped fishing pole made their way to the earthloch archives.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was just like back on earth where lakes like nasser and tonle sap could sustain populations in the tens of millions even after the dark ages of the mid-second millennia.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the large lakes here such as loch sagathan too had an incredible bounty.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the smaller ones were nothing to scoff at either.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the dhionne servants from the squeaky young to the grizzled elderly now had five times their previous drive to flourish.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they went about their days scheming to bite into the haughty mortal gheists that had eluded them for generations as the opportunity opened up along with elrhains sagely technological breakthrough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in every settlement and in every family dinner of every mortal home the talk was dominated by the little princeliness of the main house and his marvelous creation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " first the princess cured the swamplings curse.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my old mother drank that salt-honey water for a few days and now shes fishin with my son till night break.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she hit me with a cane when i told her to take it easy!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " aye.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " my seven cycle old daughter brought home a crocofish hatchling tonight.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i dont remember the last time we servant folks could eat meat every day of the week.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i doubt even our fathers and the ones before them had the chance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before this from hearsay and rumours most of the servants and freemen had merely heard how talentless the prince was.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " one unknown spirit barely blessed him at the very end of the night of blessings which contrasted ridiculously with the near one hundred thousand of the princesss.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone also knew that elrhains siaglas family were former servants.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it would be a lie to say there was no discontent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to the rest of earthlochs mortals who did not enjoy a sudden golden pie falling down on their laps from the heavens it was through and through unfair even if the words in their hearts were unvoiced.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the advent of the fishing pole completely flipped that perception on its head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " most mortal dhionne only wanted to eat good food rest a deep relaxing sleep at night and spend a few moments of meaningful time with their family during meals.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nobles granted them responsibility and security.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " while they were both essential for survival in this unkind world they had long grown desensitized to it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " every day was the same and again things changed for the worse with the collapse.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " most didnt hope for ascension like the cultivators.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the grandiose dreams of the mighty were not even as important as an over-ripe cloudberry they could pick up from the muddy ground.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but this the fishing pole.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this was the first time in the servants lives that the nobles the main house specifically had accorded them a tangible means to hold part of their fate in their own hands.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " right now they too were hunters.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " whereas before they could only have one portion of manna-rich gheist meat one or two times a month now they could eat it three times a day every day in the season.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as for manna?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " well mortal gheists were undeniably a weak source of nourishment and manna for earthen and up cultivators.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but for mortal servants and freemen it was more than enough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " in fact it was easier to digest and refine mortal level manna with the shoddy cultivation methods mortals practised than anything higher.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and quantity after a definite threshold could also become quality.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nourishment and manna a servant child could now get after eating lake-catch for every meal far outstripped the paltry sum of earthen-manna he could barely cultivate with one small gheist meat meal one or two times a month.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it didnt take long before word of one breakthrough after another reached elrhains ears.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dhionne who were stuck at peak mortal because of insufficient manna gorged themselves with the sudden bonanza of manna-filled food.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " after that it was purely a matter of their master houses bestowing them with ichors.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before the master houses overlooked them during resource distributions as their talent wasnt worthy of the investments of high-manna foodstuff.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but they now took care of the food themselves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at the same time the nobles could plentifully replenish ichors in the near future of the collapse.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no noble house would be unwise enough to not build up their cultivator ranks.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " as expected of the three leaders!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they mustve known that his princeliness elrhain was a saint reborn.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hahaha!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this old servant swears on the lake and clouds to serve the earthloch siorrakty and the prince consort until my bones are ground to dirt.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for if not for the princes generosity i would have been stuck in the mortal realms even in death.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " these developments also positively affected the out-tribals.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some of them initially learnt the craft of fishing poles from a few of their friendlier earthloch neighbours which then spread like a virus among their communities.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this solved most of their food worries.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " according to thundham this was presumably one of the key factors why the re-settlement of the out-tribals was progressing so smoothly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " besides recognition and daily doses of noble fawning elrhain and agwyns daily lives also changed significantly.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they now had to be scried every other day in tingly magic rituals.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the usually calm uncle next door master shaman tudor was likewise incensed like no other.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " his face after learning of agwyns condition was truly a sight to behold.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the short man scolded her for her neglect weeks on end until the little buns ears turned purple.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he also cruelly increased both their cultivation loads ten times over.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for agwyn that was honing her already ignited nodes with even further concentrated potent manna.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for elrhain he now consumed so many elixirs a day that any sane health expert back on earth would have keeled over at the mere mention.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " doping was evidently an accepted practice when it came to enhancing the performances of important toddlers in fanas diosca.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it didnt take long for the two to get bored out of their minds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they now spent 50 of their time awake sitting on a glowing voodoo rock chanting mysterious magic words meditating under the stern gaze of an angry dwarf.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " lilian had forbidden them from speaking about the things they saw in their lucid dreams willy-nilly too.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain also lost most of his drive to be the father of civilization after being pestered day in and out by every blue-blooded noble prick on earthloch.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he put an indefinite pause in actualizing other earth technology favouring more immediate short-term dopamine spikes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a habit from his investor days.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the boy could become lost in trivial entertainment for months without accomplishing a single task.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but his concentration broke like a flock of spooked rabbits the moment something important cropped up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " adult alex fischer could still push through even if there was no enthusiasm.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he was an influential ex-scientist and venture capitalist after all.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he had obligations and principles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " toddler elrhain couldnt be bothered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he and agwyn had agreed to try to live this life slowly and peacefully as much as possible.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cultivation drained their mental fuel too much sapping any other motivation they had for problem solving.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " both of them were yet undoubtedly confused about what exactly they wished to even do in the future.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for now quietly spending the long days mindlessly playing with their friends and family sounded like a fantastic idea.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dhionne had long lives and cultivators lived even longer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " besides there were no urgent matters like the swamplings curse popping up which they had no moral choice but to intervene in.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the clan could handle other issues pertaining to the collapse well enough.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so the decision was unanimous that happiness triumphed obligations fun won over principles.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " at least for now.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " and to the two that happiness might mean messing around with ysbail in their free time and going on one-sidedly romantic dates when cadfael wasnt looking.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " before they knew it ashfall had also passed with equinox right around the corner.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt until the first actual threat to their lives that elrhain and agwyn re-found their motivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " chapter 68 shift and attack\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the out-tribals settled in the outskirts of lochuir.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " not directly by the borders of the inner and outer circles but about an hour or two alleigh-ride away compared to native earthlochian villages.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " cant they live any closer to the township?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain asked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he pointed at the few lake-side cliff-hanging villages.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they were strewn about unplanned and he couldnt see where one village ended and another began.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the village centres were easy to spot.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bustling cores of areas in that mess of dhionne huts where children from various groups of out-tribals and freemen tribes played.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the womenfolk looked after the young while weaving clothes or carving shells.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the elderly scoured the nearby mountains for edible plants and roots.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " most mortal men gathered by the lakes fishing poles in hand.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they hunted gheists from crabs to fish.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " every so often elrhain could hear cheers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " today only captain anouk accompanied the two.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ysbail had an awful toothache and cati couldnt bear to leave her best friend alone.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the nobles wont allow it especially palaikt sonoras people.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " captain anouk replied with a sigh.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he raised a hand and alleigh trotted to a stop near the cliff trail heading to the nearest village entrance.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " two shadows materialized before them casting a dark silhouette on the ground.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " halt!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the left one shouted a midget of a man with purple skin.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " who are you?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why do you bring a gheist to our village?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the second man remained silent.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but elrhain could see him perspiring.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " anouk went forward and introduced himself.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he then pressed with a stern expression the prince and princess want to visit your village and under the three leaders orders their wants will be met.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " where are the out-tribal leaders of the settlements by the seven pearl lakes?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " bring them to me with haste!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a heavy aura enveloped captain anouk demonstrating his oceanic cultivation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the mild-mannered man transformed into a beast who only took yes for answers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the two men shuddered.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they may have similar shadow powers like cadfael but their mastery paled in comparison judging by how their form kept flickering under anouks stare.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the out-tribal guards stammered a few words and left as quickly as they came agreeing to relay the matter to their leaders.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn tugged elrhains sleeves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " uncle anouk looks funny.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he has to act tough as our bodyguard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " dont make fun of him but i agree its like forcing an e-sports gamer to dance on tv.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn giggled.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she put a tiny floral crown on elrhains head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the princess had learnt this craft from eluned recently.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was a fun pastime.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn said it was more meditative than actual meditation and she didnt get sore butts from perching on glowing rocks all day.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " anouk who kept vigil as he awaited the return of the out-tribal men all of a sudden looked up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he lurched his gaze across the few settlements by the smaller lakes muttering somethings not right.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain cocked his head and the floral crown almost slipped off.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what isnt?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the air.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " theres.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " something familiar in the flow of manna here that reminds me of a before he could finish he was interrupted by a deafening roar akin to an explosion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " all the sounds of nature stopped in unison including the crick of critters and chirps of the birds.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " replacing it was a cacophony of howls and screeches.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " w-what?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn hugged elrhains arms for balance as alleigh jolted up.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the red pengyte growled spooked by the abrupt incursion of the threat.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this is bad anouk yelled its a gheistrum outbreak.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a manna-riogh mustve overflowed!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " no sooner had he finished part of the seven pearl lakes blasted up into water sprouts by the shoreline.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the serene picture of the lake-side villages shattered in the blink of an eye.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a legion of gheistrums vengeful and malicious stormed out of the lake before pouncing on the dhionne like hungry scourges.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the villagers were first shocked.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but the men soon fought their fear away and evacuated the shore in a practised motion.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " amidst the roars and the cries of both gheist and dhionne a battle for life commenced.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " mortals filled their bodies with manna more frenzied than the gheistrums themselves.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they may not be qualified cultivators but their zeal to protect their family more than made up for it.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain and agwyn watched the carnage unfold with mouths agape.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the princes eyes ached as he shared his vision not even knowing how to respond to such a sudden shift in the situation.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but what flustered them more than the army of gheists was how quickly the out-tribals reacted to death.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it was as if fighting to stay alive was a daily matter.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " why so suddenly?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn muttered her face pale.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain couldnt answer.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he took out an amulet and pressed the blue gem etched in the middle.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a barrier of blue light materialized around alleigh tinting the clash outside in an indigo hue.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " alleigh growled turning his snout towards east where the closest shoreline met the lake water.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " theres more.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " said anouk readying his totem daggers.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " prince elrhain if i am to fall order alleigh to retreat immediately?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " chiiiiiiiittttttt!!!!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " !\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a blast of mist and a second swarm of gheistrums crawled out from below the sandy lake beach.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this time elrhains group was the target of the many bloodshot eyes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the gheists looked like a cross between a crab and a centipede.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " chitttt!!!!!!!\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " anouk clicked his tongue relaxing.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " his right hand bore into the gheists exoskeleton like a pile-driver.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but it didnt stop there.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a ray of crimson light went out the other end of the gheist like an arrow and pierced three more kiklas crawling behind.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the shooting star of death took out four other kiklas that had somehow crept near alleigh.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " awweigh!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " we gotta end the battle here fast and help the out-tribals!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain didnt refute her.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " he pushed the gem in the middle of the amulet two more times then patted alleighs head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the barrier retracted until it contoured the two kids like clothes.\n"}
