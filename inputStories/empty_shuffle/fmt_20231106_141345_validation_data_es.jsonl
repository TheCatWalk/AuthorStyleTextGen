{"prompt": "", "completion": " the answer to all her woes and misery was closer than ever before.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the cultivators agreed.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " they looked flat smooth even.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " yes.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " i can too!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " eiiigh she felt elrhain make another unintelligible noise.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " agwyn clapped the insides of her fists together so ten times more?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ahhh my head.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " what about the whole fanas dioscas and the other discs?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a wise decision.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " she turned herself in when she saw the raptors and stingrays in the sky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " the critical point is so long as you dont cross me for some fantasy girl out there like siani we wont have any problems.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " there was something in that expression that he didnt quite like.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " hence his and cadfaels fight would be different.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " aye thats a longclaw crawfish alright.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but that was fine.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " this mental link do you think we can speak telepathically?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " they could see a bustling community from the last mountain near the lake with about ten or twenty houses.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " her eyes stretched wider than any human possibly could and the vine-like beautiful markings on her body seemed to wreath in rage.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " b-but the son.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " unlike methods used by nobles it couldnt form nascent totem before the earthen realm significantly hampering our potential.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " was it because of the joke auntie lilian made?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " he sat up with an unknown urgency he could not put his finger on only to discover a fuming agwyn with a face so violet it looked like she was asphyxiating.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " i merely speak of discarding the old and bringing in the new!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " elrhain replied to her grumbles with mean logic of his own.\n"}
