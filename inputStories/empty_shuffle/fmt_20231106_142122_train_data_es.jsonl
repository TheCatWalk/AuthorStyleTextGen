{"prompt": "", "completion": " it wasnt the many lofty mountain peaks that touched the sky nor on the aenraad riverside deltas from which many tributaries branched out in all directions.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " the brightest of the lot about sixty at a cursory glance numbering perhaps less than one-tenth of the total gave off mainly a water-logged impression.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " its done right?\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " it will be safer that way.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " um im sowwy for not listening.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like a field of flowers closing bloom from north to south with but a breaths interval.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " okay tell me what you have to say.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " everyone servants freemen and nobles alike had clambered down from the ridges left the stages and ran out from their dwellings in both fear and hope.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " even us cultivators have to make do with lesser and smaller dwellings far below our prestige.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " gwynnie!\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to answer your question yes it is in fact extremely beneficial to me if you could just laze around at home without me having to wipe your behinds every time something goes wrong.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but there was a faint flicker of hope she didnt wish to so quickly snuff a yearning for friendship and fruitful bonds.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " after she had wailed in this simple fact for the last thirty cycles today for the first time in her life she glimpsed the tail of a different answer in the sea of despair.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " it looked odd unbalanced and blurry since the distance was so great like trying to see the feathers of a bird soaring in the sky.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " thus despite her flailing she was dragged down to the elders rest with the giddy cati while agwyn whispered to elrhain with an imperceptible grin you evil little bastard.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " by then cyra had walked to thundham sending some slanted glances towards the newly arrived crowd.\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " randuman waved his hand.\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " how did you see all that without shades or a telescope?\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " maybe he didn't laugh hard enough.\n"}
